Her name may have been pluralized but <EVENT>Lights</EVENT> Poxleitner was a one-woman show who played and programmed her own instruments and sang her own lyrics.   Lyrically Siberia is light years from her last which was written when the singer who spent much of her childhood travelling to places like the Philippines and Jamaica with her missionary parents had left the nest and landed in Toronto. A lot of those songs came from a sad but hopeful place. I was alone and pondering a lot. I'm a lot more aware of the person I am now and each of these songs is about an experience I've gone through she says.
