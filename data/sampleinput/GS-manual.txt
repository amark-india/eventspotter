Supporting Acts: Deceitful Lapwings   <EVENT>Murder Of Crows</EVENT>   The Murder of Crows is an atmospheric alternative band from Duluth MN. The duo consists of guitarist / vocalist Alan Sparhawk (Low Retribution Gospel Choir & The Black Eyed Snakes) and violinist/vocalist Gaelynn Lea (Sn�Ã��Â�¶barn). The Murder of Crows was formed when Sparhawk and Lea did a live soundtrack to a Lon Chaney film screening in October 2011. Although at first it seemed an unlikely pairing  with Alans long history in the indie rock world and Gaelynns classical/folk background  their divergent musical styles created a complementary sound which was really quite lovely. Whats more it turns out they enjoyed playing together so the Murder was born. At its core The Murder of Crows is built around slow winding hypnotic instrumentals that hopefully create a kind of mental journey. ;

The duo is currently featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine for the first time (January 19 issue). In celebration of the release embarks on the first leg of their North American tour this March featuring sold-out shows at Chicagos United Center DCs Verizon Center and two nights at New Yorks Madison Square Garden followed by a second batch of April dates including shows at Austins Frank Erwin Center and Tulsas BOK Center. Special guests Arctic Monkeys open on the tour.  In anticipation of the release the duo recently joined Steve Buscemi on the December 2 episode of Saturday Night Live. This was the bands second time in 2011 as musical guests on the show a rare distinction says Rolling Stone. Other recent television appearances include The Colbert Report and the Late Show with David Letterman. Produced by Danger Mouse and The Black Keys El Camino was recorded in the bands new hometown of Nashville during the spring of 2011. In advance of the release the albums first single Lonely Boy was released in October to acclaim from fans and press the song climbed the radio charts rapidly and is currently 1 on the AAA chart and has spent weeks at 1 on the Alternative chart. It also has entered the top 10 at Rock radio. Additionally the accompanying video has been viewed nearly six million times on YouTube.   Describing the sound of the album drummer Patrick Carney tells Rolling Stone Every record we figure out the mood and stick with that. With Brothers we were listening to a lot of hip-hop and old R&B and drawing from that. This is the first record weve made where its all rock & roll. And in an interview with Spin Magazine Auerbach says Ive never been into guitar solos. I really like when every instrument in the band is a rhythm instrument. This record has a lot of that going on guitar bass drums and keyboards all working together as a rhythm instrument. But unlike Brothers which has more of these slower songs with an open feeling the new LP is definitely fast.  El Camino follows the most successful two years in The Black Keys career. In May 2010 they released their breakthrough album Brothers. It won three Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award and topped numerous year-end lists. Brothers which included the hit singles Tighten Up and Howlin for You has been certified Gold in the U.S. and U.K. and Platinum in Canada. U.S. sales are nearly one million and counting.

Neither lead singer David Shaw nor guitarist Zack Feinberg realized that life was going to be different when they randomly met in 2007. Two weeks after moving to New Orleans from Ohio David Shaw was on his Birch Street porch with an acoustic guitar strumming an original song called Purple Heart. A passing bicyclist stopped to listen. He turned out to be Zack Feinberg a guitarist in search of a band. Shaw and Feinberg struck up a conversation a friendship and eventually The Revivalists. Four years later the Revivalists look and sound like a band on the brink. In 2011 they were named Best Emerging Artist at Gambit Magazine's Big Easy Awards which in 2012 has nominated them as Best Rock Band. ; ;

But there's one prophecy that's still relatively obscure and it predicts that on December 21st 2012 the world will end  for people without beards. This three age-old foretelling has prompted the world's most beard-related theme band to spring into action. From September 28th The Beards will embark upon their biggest Australian tour to date in an attempt to convince as many cleanchins as possible to repent before it's too late. We told you to grow beards said The Beards' front man Johann Beardraven. This will be your last chance. <EVENT>The 2012 End of The World (for beardless people) Tour</EVENT> will see the band take their three album back-catalogue of songs about beards throughout Australia with dates in Brisbane Sydney Melbourne Canberra Adelaide Hobart Perth Fremantle Bunbury Margaret River Newcastle Wollongong Byron Bay Bundaberg Rockhampton Mackay Townsville Cairns and more. Far North Queensland is in particular need of great many beards said bassist Nathaniel Beard. The tour will coincide with the launch of The Beards' new film clip for the song Got Me a Beard from the album Having a Beard is the New Not Having a Beard.

A New York City native he picked up the banjo at age 15 after being awed by the bluegrass music of Flatt & Scruggs.  While still in high school he began experimenting with playing bebop jazz on his banjo mentored by fellow banjo renegade Tony Trischka.  In 1980 he released his first solo album Crossing the Tracks with material that ranged from straight ahead bluegrass to Chick Coreas Spain.  In 1982 Fleck joined the progressive bluegrass band New Grass Revival making a name for himself on countless solo and ensemble projects ever since as a virtuoso instrumentalist.

Supporting Acts: Jon Eric   <EVENT>Pert Near Sandstone</EVENT>   Take old time music off the back porch throw out the hillbilly reputation and put it in the hands of a group of guys that like to work hard and play even harder. <EVENT>Pert Near Sandstone</EVENT> rejuvenates American stringband music with raw energy they play tightly-crafted original material that lends itself to the modern audience as well as being stewards of the old-time and bluegrass traditions. They are just as at home playing fully acoustic in the traditional style as they are plugged in at an indie rock venue. From saloons to theaters hollering into a single microphone and laying thick rhythm on driving fiddle melodies their sweat-inducing foot-stomping live performances keep crowds begging for more all night long. Pert Near Sandstone emerged from the same roots-based musical hotbed in Minneapolis that gave birth to Bob Dylan The Jayhawks and Spider John Koerner. Originally formed by four friends from the same hometown Pert Near Sandstone formed unintentionally over weekly whiskey-fueled picking sessions in an old house in St. Paul MN. They decided without any real intentions to start playing shows and the chemistry of their music and friendships even early on left people feeling like the party followed them everywhere they went. Word of the bands' uncanny ability to whip audiences into frenzies spread and they were invited to play some of Minnesota's most legendary venues including First Avenue the Cedar Cultural Center and the Historic Orpheum Theater. The band has been taking their show across the country paying their dues in smoke filled taverns and roadside juke joints while organically building a dedicated following from coast-to-coast. Their formative years on the road painstakingly paved the Pert Near path as the band traversed from city-to-city winning over audiences the old fashioned way face-to-face. Over the course of the next five years the band maintained a full touring schedule appearing at many national festivals and sharing the stage with many legendary musical talents the likes of Del McCoury WILCO and Yonder Mountain Stringband. In 2008 Pert Near Sandstone was hand-picked by Garrison Keillor to appear as the featured musical guest on A Prairie Home Companion where Garrison proclaimed that The group has become a force on the Minnesota roots music scene and beyond. Fellow Minnesota speed-grass band Trampled by Turtles is proud to waive the Pert Near flag high and wide with band leader Dave Simonett calling <EVENT>Pert Near Sandstone</EVENT> one of his favorite contemporary bluegrass acts in the United States. The band's stock is sharply on the rise with their recent victory at the prestigious Northwest String Summit Band Competition.

Queen the kings of arena rock performed to packed stadiums around the globe for over two decades. Freddie took showmanship by a rock front man to a new untapped level and was undisputedly crowned the lord of arena rock. He mesmerized audiences with his charismatic energy and larger than life stage persona. Upon his death in 1991 a huge void was left in the rock concert world which to this day has not yet been matched. <EVENT>Queen Nation</EVENT> a tribute to Queen was formed in 2004. <EVENT>Queen Nation</EVENT> consists of: Joe Retta or Gregory Finsley on vocals & keyboards as Freddie Mercury Mike McManus on guitar as Brian May Pete Burke on drums as Roger Taylor and Parker Combs on bass as John Deacon. The mission of the show is to carry on the musical torch and pay homage to the golden age of vintage Queen concerts. Queen Nations live 90-minute production of Queens greatest hits preserves the image sound and stage persona of vintage Queen. Audiences are amazed at the accuracy of Queen Nations live retrospective journey through such Queen songs as We Will Rock You  Bohemian Rhapsody  We Are The Champions  Crazy Little Thing Called Love  Youre My Best Friend  Another One Bites The Dust  Under Pressure and many more. They have performed in front of thousands of people at casinos fairs festivals and private affairs. JOE RETTA - VOCALS / PIANO Joe Retta is a talented singer and performer who has an uncanny ability to totally assume the role of rock's greatest icons. His role accomplishments include Ronnie James Dio Paul Rogers Robert Plant and of course Freddie Mercury. Joe can easily recreate the vocals of the late Queen frontman complete with his dead-on physical appearance and on-stage mannerisms. Growing up in Rochester New York Joe's biggest influences were Stevie Wonder Edgar Winter Steve Walsh (Kansas) and lovely and talented Cher.

One of the most enduring qualities of music lies in its ability to be transportative - the very best songs can take you almost instantly to a specific moment in time or perhaps a particular location even evoke a specific emotion. It is an immutable relationship we have with the music we listen to and it is one which the London duo of Elizabeth Sankey and Jeremy Warmsley aka Summer Camp realise so perfectly crafting twinkling pristine pop gems which sound as though they could have been discovered in a trunk in an attic glinting and glittering like jewels at the bottom of the sea.

Her name may have been pluralized but Lights Poxleitner was a one-woman show who played and programmed her own instruments and sang her own lyrics.   Lyrically Siberia is light years from her last which was written when the singer who spent much of her childhood travelling to places like the Philippines and Jamaica with her missionary parents had left the nest and landed in Toronto. A lot of those songs came from a sad but hopeful place. I was alone and pondering a lot. I'm a lot more aware of the person I am now and each of these songs is about an experience I've gone through she says. This record came from a very happy place.   Siberia's beats skitter and thwack the retro electronics fire like decomposing lasers and the analog synths dirty up her trademark pretty melodies propelling Lights' emotion-soaked but still-cute croon into her sprawling imperfect new sound.  Call it anti-electro dream-step or perhaps even grit-pop. Whatevs. Just rest assured that it's the same bright Lights she's just built herself a bigger city.

By breaking through heartache David Ramirez has gone on a search for understanding. The Austin resident and frequent traveler to clubs theaters and listening rooms all over the country has come to a phase in his creative life where the tears have dried and moving on looks like the best option. That change in perspective hasnt erased the weary searching that has characterized Ramirezs sparse Americana songwriting for more than a decade. It just means the questions hes asking on his new album Apologies have changed. Theres less to do with heartache and a lot more to do with personal struggles and hope. I see a lot of hope in these songs Ramirez 29 says. I've been working on these and many other songs for a couple years but I didn't know what I wanted this album to say until right before going into the studio. Once I finished 'An Introduction' I knew this was going to be a very personal album. That song finds Ramirez standing in a Roman cathedral looking for God  singing atop a simple but driving shuffle  while the sparse acoustic guitar-and-voice number Goodbye shows him closing the book (and setting it ablaze) on a relationship that seems to have left him permanently unsettled. Whether solo or with accompaniment Ramirez and his characters make an impression which is why Paste magazine called him The best damn songwriter you don't know yet and folk stars The Civil Wars praised him as Soulful stirring heartbreaking. ;

Self-described as sonic brutality The UKs The Jim Jones Revue is a powerhouse of vintage 50s punk and soul. Whipping crowds into a frenzy with their stripped down piano-heavy Jerry Lee Lewis flare. Their 2010 critically-acclaimed album Burning Your House Down produced by Jim Sclavunos (Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds/Grinderman) captures the roar of an untamed band at the top of their game. With the microphone shredding wail of the incomparable Jim Jones at the helm fearlessly spurred by Rupert Ortons six-string maelstrom Elliot Mortimers savaged ivories and the jackhammer rhythm section of drummer Nick Jones and bassist Gavin Jay The Jim Jones Revue swing like a giant ball and chain. The Jim Jones Revue are a rock'n'roll band whose fans are made up of those 'who've seen it all before and to those who've never seen it at all. This is a band that turns every shack it plays into a mad asylum of rocknroll psychosis - Mojo

Kids In Glass Houses Deaf Havana Neville Staple of The Specials Futures The Skints The Lagan Tall Ships and DJs Cyantific and David Rodigan are the first of our announcements. There's three music areas over the 5000 capacity site plus more non-music features still to be announced. As well as being a record shop we at Banquet Records are a concert promoter throughout the year (last year alone we put on over 200 shows!).

After many false starts with potential locations in and around Kingston we've found the perfect site to put on some of our favourite bands from the different music worlds that Banquet loves. The grounds are excellent the staging and the PA are everything we could have hoped for the parking and travel links are bang on. Unlike anywhere in Kingston the alcohol licensing rules are such that there'll be no restrictions for over 18s to have a beer in the sun and watch some great bands whilst people of all ages are invited to come to the festival.

Supporting Acts: Polar Bear Club Transit The Story So Far Into It Over It   <EVENT>The Wonder Years</EVENT>   What was originally a one-off song written by a group of bored suburban kids turned into a five-year plan none of them were expecting. Call it the ultimate after-school project. With only the intent and purpose of taking that one song and infecting it on everyone they knew this ragtag group of socially awkward musicians called The Wonder Years found themselves in the middle of a burgeoning - wait for it - career. Now as the band joins the Hopeless Records family it's obvious their easygoing short-term plans have changed dramatically. The Wonder Years have come a long way from piggybacking their friends' shows in Philly with that one initial song to sharing stages with the likes of New Found Glory Set Your Goals and Comeback Kid. Oh and Boyz II Men. Comprised of Dan Soupy Campbell (vocals) Casey Cavaliere and Matt Brasch (guitar) Nick Steinborn (keys/guitar) Josh Martin (bass) and Michael Kennedy (drums) they're a band that used to borrow gear from their friends trying to make shows memorable and exciting without worrying whether it was a perfect set or if they were even on time. It shows what the relatable appeal of a band can do - even when as in the early days they're not even really trying. Their influences ranging from tour mates NFG to Saves the Day and the Hold Steady are apparent in the attitude of a band that just want to connect with their audience in the most authentic and unpretentious way possible. We're just ourselves all the time and we don't have any rad gimmicks Campbell said. We play loud and fast and recklessly. We front flip off speakers and sweat and spit and break just about everything. We've walked off stage needing stitches more than once. We're a band very much charge of ourselves. We always kind of know exactly what we want to do and exactly how we want to do it and we like Hopeless because they let us do just that Campbell said. The Wonder Years released their follow up to The Upsides this year. Their highly anticipated album Suburbia I've Given You All And Now I'm Nothing is available now.

Supporting Acts: Kill the Reflection Young Lyons   <EVENT>The Secret Post</EVENT>   The Secret Post is the brainchild of Zachariah Wiser. The Post came into existence in early 2004 as an outlet for Zachariah's post-punk/New Wave influences to flourish. The Post started out as Zachariah himself all alone recording home demo's as he was busy with WiseMan at the time. Zachariah moved back to Tulsa his hometown in the summer of 2006. He quickly began the hunt for members to make this project come to life. The Secret Post made a huge impact on the Tulsa scene a few short months later with a string of shows unlike that of which Tulsa hadn't seen in years. With Post-Punk long gone this band decided to bring it back with the passion and stature of a brand new genre. The band is led by Zachariah's brooding vocals and metaphorical lyrics about sex death despair and love...with his melancholic and sometimes Staccato jerky rhythm guitar leading the way. ;

Born in 1988 he spent his time in school rhyming and battling his friends for fun. In his 10th grade he began rapping writing songs and recording them in a friend's basement before selling them at school.

He even sent a friend request to Scooter Braun an Atlanta-based promoter and former VP of Marketing for Jermaine Dupri's record label So So Def. One week after making friends with Scooter through the social network he flew to Atlanta and was immediately signed by Scooter who subsequently became his manager. Asher then decided leaving college and focused on his career as Hip-Hop artist. He dropped an indie album titled Believe the Hype in 2006.

Singer songwriter guitarist and showman extraordinaire Igor Yuzov is perpetually globetrotting and in the process he has found scores of wildly talented entertaining musicians to bring into the fold of this increasingly international party band. Red Elvises started as a Russian group playing what they dubbed Siberian Surf Rock. Since then the band has included musicians from many other countries including United States Israel Puerto Rico and Bulgaria to name just a few. Everyone who performs with them for any length of time brings something different both energetically and musically. At various times shows have included keyboards accordions sax clarinet trumpet flute banjo mandolin tuba and many other instruments. Old and new fans alike can expect to be surprised at shows again and again however the roots of Red Elvises remain the same: Igor's unique brand of humor combined with guitar based rock'n'roll that makes audiences want to sing dance scream and shout.

Supporting Acts: New Kingston Los Rakas   <EVENT>Collie Buddz</EVENT>   Collie Buddz from the isle of Bermuda has done something not impossible but something once seemingly very implausible. He's become the most buzz-worthy current Reggae artist over the past few years. In the summer 2007 Collie Buddz' Columbia Records self-titled debut album stormed the charts entering the Billboard Reggae Chart at first position. The Reggae singjay became an international star when this album went on to debut across the world on every chart from Japan to Germany. With much of the production coming from Collie himself he delivered a solid effort with contributions from Supa Dups Shea Taylor Bang Out Screwface Bobby Konders and Crown N Kah-So-Real. Released just a day before US Independence Day Collie's album could be heard blasting out of car windows from Brooklyn to Kingston all summer long. Critically speaking Collie's debut was a monster his first single an undeniable summer anthem titled Come Around. Source Magazine proclaimed This 24 year old shotta has got an anthem spreading across the seas. Hip Hop Weekly said Collie Buddz is one of the most firmly grounded voices you may ever encounter. The industry excitement about this new voice in music manifested in many ways namely by inspiring Collie's musical peers to either create their own remixes of Come Around or join Collie on the official remix of the single. Busta Rhymes G-Unit Shaggy and Cypress Hill all contributed to the anthem. Incorporating influences from Hip-Hop to Soca Collie's music nevertheless has a rock-solid foundation in Reggae - and its power to connect ghetto reality with the highest heights of human aspiration - that is a rarity even in Jamaica. But to say he's connected to the Caribbean community would be an understatement. Collie Buddz born Colin Harper has become the Caribbean culture's resident ambassador. Touring extensively Collie's passport stamps are a relative reflection of the worldwide love for Reggae and Caribbean culture. From Madison Square Garden to Dubai Collie Buddz is the definition of an international recording artist. It was crazy performing in the Middle East. Who would have guessed how big reggae music is there?

Like her utterly unique stage outfits its made from disparate individual elements that wouldnt work on paper but sing out like a holy choir in the execution. Adding muscle to Beths far-ranging vocals are her band The Hooves Of Destiny. Comprising Dav Shiel (drums vocals samples) Rory Gibson (bass vocals) Ed Blazey (guitar trumpet vocals) and Findlay Macaskill (violin vocals) theyre a crack unit recruited from Beths native North East. Songs about boys and dreams have never sounded so forceful and proud as these and theres plenty more to unpick in Beths hugely inventive lyrics. Having recorded the album without a record deal to ensure complete creative control it will be released on Mute the label described by Houghton as The one that still believed in my record after everyone else had gone to the pub. Now ready for release Beth sees the album as an animal I'm preparing to ride. Grooming it feeding it braiding its hair and I feel that Ben has built me a saddle that is both practical and comfortable to use. And because of this I feel confident in its release. DRIVER DRIVE FASTER Driver Drive Faster are a band from Manchester but you wouldnt necessarily tell: theirs is a timeworn sound that exists somewhere between Americana and spectral indie rock. Its crafted song-writing at its best hinging on stirring chord sequences and moments of fragile beauty. Taking their name from the first line in WH Audens poem Calypso in which hes running late to meet his lover Driver Drive Faster comprise Dylan and Japan-born bassist Yuri Caul who met at school in Torquay Devon plus Durham-born Peet Earnshaw and German drummer David Schlechtriemen. Following 2011s supremely well-received debut album Open House Driver Drive Faster are set to return with a brand new single aptly named To Return and aptly sounding like the work of a band brimming with confidence and good feeling.
