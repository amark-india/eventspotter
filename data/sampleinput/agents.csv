"The Black Keys","Royal Headache","Sydney Entertainment Centre","Love Police welcome... <br>THE BLACK KEYS <br>THE BLACK KEYS are the hottest rock and roll act on the planet right now!  <br>After selling out arenas all through the USA, Canada, UK and Europe and headlining Coachella and Lollapalooza and many other festivals they are very pleased to announce their long awaited return to Australia this October. <br>Their latest (and seventh) album ‘El Camino' is selling truckloads everywhere and its infectious opening track ‘Lonely Boy' is a certified global smash hit single and they'll be bringing all these tracks and more to Australian audiences with their electrifying new live show. <br>The show features huge visuals from 20 projectors, giant mirror balls, and all the hits from their deep and consistently awesome back catalogue. <br>The transformation of THE BLACK KEYS from a 2 piece garage band playing small clubs to being worthy headliners of arenas and festivals could not be more just or complete and proves that the pure combination of good times, great music and grit can still turn to gold. <br>Rest assured, you haven't see a show like this before. <br>THE BLACK KEYS have a deep love affair with Australia. They toured here first in 2003 just in time for the release of their second album, \"\"Thickfreakness\"\". Since then they have toured here 5 more times, played every major city and many regional towns multiple times, as well as Bluesfest, The Falls, Groovin' The Moo, Pyramid Rock and West Coast Blues & Roots festivals. They are loved from Darwin to Tassie, from Byron Bay to Geelong. Every true music fan has a Black Keys story to tell, and this October tour will be another big, big chapter. <br>Joining the band on all shows will be Sydney's outstanding ROYAL HEADACHE. These zeitgeist-straddling purveyors of DIY garage soul are the most exciting musical thing happening in our country right now. Their debut self titled album of last year was highly loved and rated by all from the 'burbs to the inner city hipsters. Get there early to experience and believe their power. "

"Little Big Show","First Aid Kit","The Neptune Theatre","KEXP, STG and Starbucks join our Seattle-loving hearts to bring you Little Big Show, a concert series created to benefit our city’s arts organizations. <br>Four times a year, we find a great band or two, give ‘em the stage at The Neptune and donate 100% of ticket sales to a local non-profit. It’s the little show with a big effect. <br>Previous shows, featuring performances by Pickwick, Real Estate and Dum Dum Girls raised over $28,000 for Arts Corps, Coyote Central and NFFTY. Let’s round out the year for our new beneficiary, 826 Seattle – a writing and tutoring center. <br>To learn more about 826 Seattle and the difference you will be making by attending this show, please visit <a href=\"\"http://826seattle.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://826seattle.org/</a>. <br>Tickets on sale Friday, August 24th at 10am! <br>First Aid Kit: <br>Bittersweet is the word the Söderberg sisters prefer. “We like bittersweet songs, songs that affect you differently depending on how you interpret them,” says Klara, the younger of the Swedish siblings that make up First Aid Kit. “Making the melodies and lyrics head in different directions is very deliberate,” adds big sister Johanna. “A song like ‘Emmylou’ sounds cheerful, but the lyrics are the saddest thing you ever heard.” First Aid Kit’s first US-recorded album, The Lion’s Roar, juxtaposes sadness and beauty in the best traditions of folk and country music. They even cite the Louvin Brothers’ cheerfully brutal version of the old murder ballad “Knoxville Girl” as the perfect example of the sweet and sour they adore. And this new carefully constructed collection deftly succeeds in setting references to their hometown of Stockholm and long, dark Scandinavian winters against a backdrop of country-rock swing. Initially signed in 2008 by The Knife-owned label Rabid Records (they are now signed to Wichita), First Aid Kit have gone from faraway teenage fans covering Fleet Foxes for fun to recording a Blue Series 7-Inch single of Buffy Sainte-Marie’s “Universal Soldier” with Jack White at his request in his Nashville, TN Third Man Studios. “I think of it now as like a dream, too good to be true,” says Johanna of the session, happily and hurriedly squeezed into last autumn’s tour schedule. Where 2010’s debut The Big Black and the Blue was starkly intimate, The Lion’s Roar, recorded in Omaha by Mike Mogis (Bright Eyes, millions more), is a full band record. The girls’ father Benkt takes the bass, Mattias Bergqvist drums, while Mogis and Nate Walcott of Bright Eyes, and a cast of Omaha-based musicians round out the sound. From the dynamic title track onwards, the album is a rich and stirring affair that expands upon the keen and sophisticated country-tinged pop of their debut. “Emmylou” name-checks such greats as Gram Parsons, Johnny Cash, June Carter, and of course Ms. Harris, yet for all its upbeat appeal, it recognizes the sadness in the lives and art of these heroes. “We’ve listened to those people for a very long time. We hadn’t even toured America when we started writing that song,” confesses Johanna. “We actually finished it in Australia,” adds Klara. The gorgeous, timeless “In The Hearts Of Men” adds mellotron alongside more expected textures. “My duality awakes,” sings Klara in the lush, knowing “I Found a Way”. The exquisite “Dance to Another Tune” perfectly conjures a haunting sense of unease, while the lovely, steady cadence of “This Old Routine” tells a plaintive, yet redemptive, tale of loves lost and re-found. “To A Poet” opens side two, so to speak, and its elegant coda, featuring a string quartet arranged by Walcott, particularly impressed the Söderbergs. “We recorded our last record at home. We couldn’t even have fit them all in,” says Klara. Despite its lonesome sound, “New Year’s Eve” – all distant reverb and atmospherics – is “actually very hopeful”. Finally the exuberant hoedown of ‘King of the World’ features The Felice Brothers, just passing through town during the session, and local hero Conor Oberst, who sings the last verse. “We’d never worked with a producer before,” says Johanna. “Yet we never disagreed with Mike about anything.” The resulting record is serious fun, yet First Aid Kit are only starting. “We want to work in music forever. Our voices and songs could work in many genres,” says Johanna, “We don’t know how we’ll sound in ten years time.” But which do they prefer singing, sad or happy songs? They roar with laughter. “We only sing sad songs.” There will never be a shortage of those, and in First Aid Kit’s hands, they will always sound nothing short of glorious. "

"The Dark Legacy Tour","Lacuna Coil","Koko","LACUNA COIL are bringing their Dark Legacy tour to the UK later this year which will be the band’s only headlining run in the UK for 2012. The shows will feature a set of more than two hours. Frontwoman Cristina Scabbia commented: “The Dark Legacy tour is a dream come true! This tour will present the history of Lacuna Coil, melding old fans with a new generation of Coilers. The Dark Legacy set will offer both the electric and acoustic vibe and absolute melodic epicness!”  <br>Frontman Andrea Ferro added, “We wanted to give our fans a special present for Lacuna Coil’s fifteenth anniversary and that was the inspiration for the Dark Legacy tour. The Dark Legacy show will be very special, with a lot of our history in a surprise-filled set. You won’t want to miss it!” "
"Summer Camp","Fixers","Scala","Set times (from Scala): <br>Fixers - 8:30 <br>Summer Camp - 9:30 <br>-------------------- <br>After selling out Efes, Summer Camp return to London's Scala for their biggest headline show to date. <br>One of the most enduring qualities of music lies in its ability to be transportative - the very best songs can take you, almost instantly, to a specific moment in time, or perhaps a particular location, even evoke a specific emotion. It is an immutable relationship we have with the music we listen to, and it is one which the London duo of Elizabeth Sankey and Jeremy Warmsley, aka Summer Camp realise so perfectly, crafting twinkling, pristine pop gems which sound as though they could have been discovered in a trunk in an attic, glinting and glittering like jewels at the bottom of the sea. "
"Trivium","As I Lay Dying","Shepherds Bush Empire","TRIVIUM‘s latest album, “In Waves”, sold 22,000 copies in the United States in its first week of release to land at position No. 13 on The Billboard 200 chart — the highest U.S. chart entry of the band’s career. The group’s previous CD, “Shogun”, opened with just under 24,000 units back in October 2008 to debut at No. 23. The effort followed up “The Crusade”, which registered a first-week tally of 31,000 copies in October 2006 to enter the chart at No. 25. <br>“In Waves” was recorded primarily at Paint It Black Studios in Orlando, Florida (with only the drums having been tracked at Audiohammer Studios in Sanford, Florida) with the production/mixing team of Colin Richardson (MACHINE HEAD, BULLET FOR MY VALENTINE, SLIPKNOT, FEAR FACTORY) and Martin “Ginge” Ford, along with engineer Carl Bown. A two-disc special edition is also available. It features five bonus tracks, plus a DVD with a 40-minute, behind-the-scenes documentary, as well as an exclusive concert filmed in a warehouse located in Orlando, Florida, which is the band’s stomping grounds. This concert features the first performances of tracks from “In Waves”, along with TRIVIUM classics. <br>AS I LAY DYING entered the studio last month to begin recording its new CD for a late 2012 release via Metal Blade Records. The CD is being helmed by Bill Stevenson, who has played drums for both the DESCENDENTS and BLACK FLAG and is one of the most highly renowned producers in rock. His production credits include work on records by RISE AGAINST, NOFX, PROPAGANDHI, THE CASUALTIES, ANTI-FLAG and many more. <br>Source: <a href=\"\"http://metalshockfinland.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://metalshockfinland.wordpress.com/</a> "

Fusing analog and digital flawlessly, giving them a totally unique and original sound. Film Noir futurism. <br>The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble (TKDE) formed in 2000 as a project to compose new music for existing silent movies. Jason Köhnen and Gideon Kiers, both graduates of the Utrecht School of Arts, combined their audio and visual skills to reinterpret classic movies by F.W. Murnau (Nosferatu) and F. Langs (Metropolis). In 2004, UK trombonist Hilary Jeffery and Swiss cellist Nina Hitz joined TKDE to record the self-titled debut album which was released on Planet Mu Records in May 2006. The ensuing tour saw Eelco Bosman and Paris based vocalist Charlotte Cegarra join, forming the Ensemble into a sextet. London based violinist Sadie Anderson joined in 2008 to supply the group with extra power on stage. <br>The Netherlands has been TKDE’s homebase since 2007, while members have moved closer to each other to make composing and producing easier. Apart from the mothership which is TKDE, there is another entity The Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporation is a live improv jazz/drone/doom sideproject consisting of TKDE members and a host of interchanging guest musicians. Due to the vast possibilities within the band, the sound spectrum of TKDE is hard to capture within one specific composition. Moreover, the project will lean towards various styles depending on the respective members working together at a given time. A good mix between atmosphere and technique is always the strong basis for a TKDE composition. <br>Live TKDE fuse analog and digital as much as possible. Combining traditional instrumentations (comprising cello, trombone, violin, beats, guitar, bass and vocals) with existing and/or self-developed software, continuously blending and mutating, creating an organic and electronic performance, supported by visuals which add to and interact with the frequencies of said instruments. <br>Apart from the mothership which is TKDE, there is another entity The Mount Fuji Doomjazz Corporation is a live improv jazz/drone/doom sideproject consisting of TKDE members and a host of interchanging guest musicians.  <br>The Kilimanjaro Darkjazz Ensemble are: <br>Jason Köhnen – Bass, Gideon Kiers – Beats / FX, Eelco Bosman – Guitar, Charlotte Cegarra – Vocals, Hilary Jeffery – Trompone <br><a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/out?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkde.net\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.tkde.net</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.facebook.com/darkjazz\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.facebook.com/darkjazz</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.twitter.com/#!/tkde_darkjazz\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.twitter.com/#!/tkde_darkjazz</a> "

"Dream Theater","Periphery","Papp László Budapest Sportaréna","A Dream Theater több mint 25 éve műveli, vezeti és szórakoztatja a közönségét. Töretlen sikerükről és fogyhatatlan energiájukról a hazai rajongók is megbizonyosodhatnak 2012. február 17-én, a Papp László Budapest Sportarénában. A 2011. szeptember 13-án megjelenő 11. stúdióalbummal, az A Dramatic Turn of Events című lemezzel ismételten formálja majd ízlésünket a legendás zenekar. A korong szívből megélt hangképeknek az összessége, és méltó utódja az olyan mérföldkőnek számító korábbi Dream Theater lemezeknek, mint az Images and Words vagy a Scenes from a Memory. A Dream Theater az új dobos, Mike Mangini érkezésével új erőre kapott, a tagok egymásnak és a rajongóknak való elkötelezettsége erősebb, mint valaha. Mindannyian egyetértenek abban, hogy az A Dramatic Turn of Events az egyik legjobban sikerült Dream Theater album. <br>A progresszív metál nem kimondottan az a stílus, ami széles körben népszerű lenne a zenekedvelők körében, a Dream Theater mégis világszerte már több, mint 8 millió lemezt adott el. Ez leginkább annak a legendás státusznak köszönhető, amit teljesen újszerű hangjukkal és lenyűgöző virtuozitásukkal sikerült kiérdemelniük. <br>A Dream Theater vendége a Periphery nevezetű zenekar lesz. <br>A koncertre Meet&Greet csomagok a következő linken érhetők el: <br><a href=\"\"http://vipnation.com/programs/dream-theater\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://vipnation.com/programs/dream-theater</a> <br>Jegyek 2011. szeptember 12-től kaphatók a Ticket Express jegyirodákban és az Eventim hálózatában. <a href=\"\"http://www.tex.hu\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.tex.hu</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.dreamtheater.net\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.dreamtheater.net</a> <br>JEGYÁRAK: 15.500 - 7.500 HUF "

Carving out a space somewhere in the middle of garage-punk snarl, shoegaze haze, and Krautrock grooves, Chicago’s Disappears features Brian Case (also of the Ponys and 90 Day Men), Boas members Graeme Gibson and Jonathan van Herik, and Damon Carruesco. The band started when Case’s other groups were on hiatus and he was recording demos with Gibson Gibson brought van Herik into the project, and in turn, van Herik brought Carruesco into the fold. Soon after forming, the band self-released a series of 7” singles with artwork based on Can’s album Delay 1968, and made their material available for free on the Internet. Disappears began recording their debut studio album and signed to Touch & Go, appearing at the label’s showcase at 2009’s South by Southwest Festival, and also playing dates with Tortoise, Deerhunter, and Times New Viking. The band released 100 CD-Rs of Live Over the Rainbo, a live album from the Deerhunter/Times New Viking tour, that was eventually distributed by Plus Tapes and Rococco Records later in 2009. Disappears continued to play more high-profile Chicago shows, including a gig at the Pitchfork Music Festival and a 2009 New Year’s Eve show with the Jesus Lizard. Late in the year, the band moved to Kranky Records, who released their official debut album Lux in 2010. The band also recorded a single with Sonic Youth’s Steve Shelley and the noise duo White/Light. "

"Cut Hands","SM","Galerie Divus Prague 7","V pátek 20.1.2012 se v Galerii Divus uskuteční pod hlavičkou Cut Hands exkluzivní performance legendy extrémní elektroniky a jednoho ze zakladatelů žánru power electronics, Williama Bennetta, leadera amerických Whitehouse. O roli domácího supportu se postará projekt S/M a Dj Aitcher Clark v Vjem Pleionem! <br>William Bennet’s <a href=\"\"http://www.myspace.com/cuthands\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Cut Hands</a>  <br>Nestor extremní elektroniky William Bennett se proslavil hlavně založením a následným působením v legendárních Whitehouse, jedné z nejextrémnějších power electronics skupin vůbec. K šokujícímu vyznění Whitehouse přispěl posléze v devadesátých letech i spisovatel Peter Sotos, který obohatil výrazové prostředky Whitehouse o svou celoživotní obsesi – patologii masových vražd a násilných trestných činů. <br>Projekt Cut Hands představuje výrazně rytmičtější tvář tvorby Williama Bennetta. Mezi stěžejní kompoziční složky patří zejména tradiční hudba afrického kontinentu smíchaná s rytmickou elektronikou, post industriálně laděnými pasážemi a psychedelickým oparem 60tých a 70tých let. Celkové vyznění skladeb Cut Hands je výrazně temné se zřetelem k bicím a rytmickým nástrojům, jejichž aranže nemají daleko k aranžím projektů jako Z’EV či ranějším Einstürzende Neubauten. Projekt byl vydán na Williamově vlastním labelu Susan Lawly. <br><a href=\"\"http://bandzone.cz/sm\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">S/M</a>  <br>O roli domácího supportu se postará počtem proměnlivé trio S/M, tvořené jednotkami A, S, J. Počátky tohoto souboru sahají až k počátkům české industriální/extremně elektronické scény, kdy vycházejí jako přímá emanace legendárních Suicidal Meditations. Od doby svého vzniku se S/M představili na bezpočtu festivalů jako Alternativa, Pražském Bienale či Prague Industrial Festival. Těšit se můžete na dark ambient/industriálně improvizovanou experimentální hudbu podbarvenou rozličnými výrazovými prostředky. <br>Po celý večer přispějí k výborné atmosféře i Dj Aitcher Clark a Vj Pleione mixem sahajícím od ambientně/industriálního minimálu až po rytmicky laděné tracky. Těšit se můžete i na výrazně posílený sound systém, HD video projekci a hlavně krásné prostředí galerie <a href=\"\"https://www.divus.cz/studio-cz/kontakt.htm\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Divus</a> v budově KC Vltavská.  <br>Koncert začíná ve 20:00.

True to the trend towards dramatic entrances in so many of the new fraternity of sensational dubstep artists, NiT GriT burst on the scene with his first show in March 2010 in a co-billing with Excision. <br>NiT GRiT on Twitter <br>@nitgritmusic <br>NiT GRiT official Site - all albums are available for free download <br><a href=\"\"http://www.nitgrit.com\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.nitgrit.com</a> <br>NiT GRiT on Facebook <br><a href=\"\"http://www.facebook.com/nitgrit\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.facebook.com/nitgrit</a> "

A Place To Bury Strangers aus Brooklyn haben ihr neuestes Werk \"\"Worship\"\" selbst produziert herausgekommen ist der hypnotisierende Sound einer Band, die alles unter Kontrolle hat und deren Musik alle Grenzen sprengt.

"Ejekt Festival 2012","Kasabian","Πλατεία Νερού, Ολυμπιακός Πόλος Φαλήρου","To EJEKT Festival επιστρέφει για 8η συνεχή χρονιά με ένα από τα κορυφαία line-ups που έχουν παρουσιαστεί ποτέ στην Ελλάδα. Πιστό στην συνταγή του να παρουσιάζει τα μεγαλύτερα ονόματα από την ροκ και dance μουσική στην ίδια σκηνή, το EJEKT 2012 και φέτος θα είναι το σημείο συνάντησης όλων των μουσικόφιλών της χώρας. <br>.  <br>Tα δύο πρώτα ονόματα του φετινού line-up είναι οι Kasabian και οι Katzenjammer. <br>Οι Kasabian, το μεγαλύτερο rock συγκρότημα που έβγαλε η Μεγάλη Βρετανία την τελευταία δεκαπενταετία και ένα από τα μεγαλύτερα απωθημένα του ελληνικού κοινού, επιτέλους θα εμφανιστούν για πρώτη φορά στην Ελλάδα! <br>.  <br>Οι δίσκοι τους έχουν γίνει πολυπλατινένιοι, τα singles τους παίζονται ασταμάτητα στο ραδιόφωνο, οι εμφανίσεις τους έχουν κερδίσει επάξια τον τίτλο του \"\"κορυφαίου live act\"\" και τα πλέον έγκριτα μουσικά περιοδικά (Mojo, NME, Q, κλπ) τους δίνουν τα σημαντικότερα βραβεία. <br>Ο λόγος: Days Are Forgotten, Reason Is Treason, L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever), Shoot The Runner, Empire, Cutt Off, Fire, Goodbye Kiss, Velocipator, Switchblade Smiles και αρκετά ακόμα τραγούδια τους έχουν στιγματίσει τα 00ς.  <br>. <br>Οι Kasabian είναι από τα ελάχιστα συγκροτήματα που έχουν καταφέρει να καθιερώσουν τον δικό τους, διαφορετικό ήχο, κάνοντας την ροκ μουσική επιτυχία σε μια εποχή που σχεδόν τίποτα δεν είναι υπερ της. <br>.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.kasabian.co.uk/gb/home/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.kasabian.co.uk/gb/home/</a> <br>.  <br>Οι Katzenjammer είναι Νορβηγίδες, τραγουδούν στα αγγλικά και παίζουν σαν Βαλκάνιες! Η μουσική του Goran Bregovic και του Django Reinhardt είναι το πρότυπό τους, αλλά μπλέκουν μέσα την ποπ, την ροκ και πολλή τρέλλα! Με τις κιθάρες, τα ακορντεόν, τα ουκελέλε και όλα τα παράξενα μουσικά όργανα που χρησιμοποιούν, στήνουν ένα μοναδικό πάρτυ επί σκηνής, τόσο αγαπητό στο κοινό ώστε να έχουν καταφέρει να περιοδεύουν σε ολόκληρη την Ευρώπη. Η εμφάνισή τους στο EJEKT 2012 είναι η πρώτη τους στην Ελλάδα και σίγουρα θα ακολουθήσουν πολλές. <br>.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.katzenjammer.no/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.katzenjammer.no/</a> <br>.  <br>Το πλήρες line-up του EJEKT Festival 2012 θα ανακοινωθεί σύντομα. <br>.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.ejekt.gr\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.ejekt.gr</a> "

"Tycho","Ansatz Der Maschine","Muziekcentrum TRIX","Tycho is de muzikale uitlaatklep van artistieke veelvraat Scott Hansen uit San Francisco. Als fotograaf en grafisch ontwerper scoort hij al enige tijd met zijn blog ISO50, muzikaal zet hij in 2011 de puntjes op de 'i' dankzij een uiterst intrigerende plaat. 'Dive' zwemt in dromerige electropop en Hansen kan op de plaat zijn fascinatie voor oude synths helemaal botvieren. Hij werkt ook graag met live instrumenten die hij zorgvuldig samplet om er vervolgens fijn uitgekiende sferen mee op te roepen. Tycho is onmiskenbaar beïnvloed door Boards Of Canada en Bibio maar houdt eerder vast aan songstructuren dan uitdeinende moody soundscapes. Het artwork van de plaat is ongelooflijk mooi en sfeervol en wordt - hoe kan het ook anders - door Scott Hansen zelf gemaakt. Op Pitchfork wordt de plaat heel goed ontvangen, bij HUMO verwoorden ze het als volgt: 'In het hersenkamertje waar wij onze mentale notities bewaren hangt sinds vorige week een verse fluogele Post-it. Die moet ons, de eerstvolgende keer dat we over Highway 1 langs de Amerikaanse westkust slingeren, de Stille Oceaan in onze ooghoek, eraan herinneren 'Dive' van Tycho op endless repeat te zetten.' Heerlijke sfeermuziek dus om volledig bij weg te dromen! <br>Ansatz Der Maschine is het muzikale geesteskind van de uit Kortrijk afkomstige componist, altviolist en elektronica-artiest Mathijs Bertel. Met de ietwat abstracte maar ideeënrijke langspelers 'The Postman is A Girl' en 'Painting Bad Weather on Her Body' eiste hij meteen een prominente plek op tussen Fennesz, múm, Aphex Twin, Helios, Console en andere gerenommeerde figuren uit het indietronicamilieu. Het nieuwe werkstuk 'Heat' bevat negen geslaagde composities. En hoewel elektronica en samples in de muziek nog steeds een voorname rol spelen, werd dit keer meer dan ooit voor een ambachtelijke aanpak gekozen. "

"Blaudzun","Dyzack","Patronaat","Singer-songwriter Blaudzun, echte naam Johannes Sigmond, overtuigde eerder met twee prachtige albums, waarvan het alom bejubelde Seadrift Soundmachine en de daaropvolgende live shows in 2010 en 2011 voor zijn doorbraak in Nederland zorgen. Op 9 januari 2012 verschijnt opvolger Heavy Flowers (V2 Records), zijn meest dynamische langspeler tot nu toe, waarop hij zijn karakteristieke zang en meeslepende melodieën combineert met een voorliefde voor folk en artrock. <br>Met zijn derde collectie liedjes overtreft hij opnieuw zijn vorige werk en lijkt hij de hooggespannen verwachtingen van fans en volgers te gaan inlossen. Net als bij de vorige twee albums schreef, arrangeerde en produceerde Johannes het geheel. ‘Ik wilde eigenlijk een klassieke singer-songwriter plaat maken. Klein,sober vooral, met één gitaar of banjo. En met als thema het Einde der Tijden. Maar dat kwam er gewoon niet uit. Alles wat ik maakte, had te veel energie voor zo’n benadering. Misschien doordat ik veel heb geschreven in een periode dat ik ook veel optrad. De adrenaline van het live spelen stroomt dan ongemerkt de composities in.’ <br>Vlak voordat Blaudzun de studio in ging, deed hij in mei 2011 nog een korte clubtour in Nederland. Sigmond: ‘Oneerbiedig gezegd heb ik daar nieuwe liedjes getest om ze vervolgens verder te bewerken en te arrangeren. Normaal werkte ik in de studio de arrangementen uit om daarna later pas te bepalen hoe ik het live wilde uitvoeren.’ Hoewel Blaudzun geen band is, heeft Johannes er wel voor gekozen om de meeste muzikanten die live met hem meedoen een rol te geven op de plaat. <br>Johannes speelt zelf gitaar, percussie, ukelele, banjo, bas en toetsen. Uiteraard doet ook zijn broer Jakobus zowel live als op het album mee, hij speelt gitaar en lapsteel. ‘En dat niet alleen. Hij is ook een klankbord tijdens het schrijven. Jakobus componeert ook voor zichzelf en dat houdt mij weer scherp. In één geval heb ik zelfs schaamteloos een idee van hem gejat en verwerkt in een eigen liedje.’ <br>Popcritici en muziekfans zijn al jaren unaniem lovend over Blaudzun. Blaudzun en zijn 8-koppige band bouwden vrij snel een bijzondere live reputatie op. Sigmond schitterde o.a. tijdens Walk The Line en Into The Great Wide Open en maakt indruk op Lowlands 2010. Hij sluit het najaar van 2010 af met een zo goed als uitverkochte clubtour. Nu dus nummer drie!  <br>Openingsact Dyzack, het legendarische eenmansorkest, komt gelukkig ook weer eens onze kant op, dus wees op tijd! "
"Other Lives","The Magnetic North","Academy 3","Hey! Manchester and Now Wave are delighted to be welcoming back Oklahoma’s Other Lives. <br>Tickets are available from Manchester University Students Union, Common (both no booking fee), Piccadilly Records, Vinyl Exchange, Seetickets.com, Ticketline.co.uk and on 0161 832 1111. <br>Other Lives formed as an instrumental project in 2004 under the name Kunek. Based in Stillwater, Oklahoma, Kunek (who eventually added vocals to the mix) released one album (Flight of the Flynns) before making the transition to the similarly themed Other Lives. The group’s eponymous debut album was produced and recorded by drummer/engineer Joey Waronker (Walt Mink, Beck, REM) and released in late 2008. <br>After getting a boost by having songs appear on Grey’s Anatomy, the band released their second album, Tamer Animals, this summer of 2011 on Play It Again Sam. They have also been asked to join Radiohead on their North America in spring 2012, having only recently finished touring with Bon Iver. <br>‘Thanks to the makeshift orchestra’s shaggy ringleader, Jesse Tabish, these wistful Americana-styled tracks (influenced by Tabish favourites Sigur Rós and Godspeed You! Black Emperor) rarely feel forced’ – 7.4/10, Pitchfork <br>‘File under Pastoral Americana alongside Fleet Foxes and Midlake, but there is a major difference: Tabish worships instrumental music, and classical minimalistsSteve Reich and Philip Glass, which accounts for the album’s pulsating orchestrations’ – BBC Music <br>‘This is sublime, transportive music to spend hours with’ – 4/5, the Guardian <br>We're pleased to announce that The Magnetic North will support. A supergroup of sorts, the project features singer-songwriter Erland Cooper (of Erland & The Carnival), Simon Tong (of The Verve) and singer/orchestral arranger Hannah Peel who have collaborated to produce Orkney: Symphony Of The Magnetic North, a new album due for release on 7 May on Full Time Hobby. It’s a beautiful, sweeping, haunting album that evokes the near-alien landscape of the Orkney Isles with drama and delicacy. <br><a href=\"\"http://otherlives.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://otherlives.com/</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.symphonyofthemagneticnorth.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.symphonyofthemagneticnorth.com/</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.heymanchester.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.heymanchester.com/</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://nowwave.co.uk/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://nowwave.co.uk/</a> "

"Botibol","Granville","Point Ephémère","La musique de Botibol (Fr) prend sa source dans l’écho sourd des souvenirs. Des premières notes sur Casiotone aux balbutiements d’un piano inondé par une crue tropicale, des trajets en voiture à observer le paysage, assis à côté des Dodos, de Chad Van Gaalen, de Sufjan Stevens, ou de Sandro Perri. Ainsi Born From A Shore, premier album sorti en février dernier, tangue constamment entre l’urgence d’un We were Foxes, l’euphorie de Friends et la mélancolie d’un Jo Cowboy. Tout ici naît d’un rivage et se disperse en particules sur une mer calme ou en plein tourment. En concert, Vincent aka Botibol est accompagné d’un batteur, et offre une dimension supplémentaire à ses compositions, entre folk dépouillé, pop cristalline et jeux harmoniques et rythmiques, jonglant avec claviers, samplers, et guitares…. <br><a href=\"\"http://www.myspace.com/botibol\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.myspace.com/botibol</a> <br>La Normandie n’est pas la Californie, mais y ressemble. Granville (Fr), groupe de pop naïve en français basé à Caen, chante une adolescence tantôt sauvage et souvent rêveuse. Rappelant aussi bien le yéyé français des années soixante (France Gall, Françoise Hardy…) que la pop garage américaine (Best Coast, Tennis..), Granville s’écoute les pieds dans l’eau, le regard vers le large, comme en vacances. <br><a href=\"\"http://www.facebook.com/granville.francaise\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.facebook.com/granville.francaise</a> "

And since when has it been any different for these four siblings from rural Victoria? <br>Their last 12 months has resembled a downhill speed-race that encompassed three continents, appearances at the biggest music festivals in the UK and Australia, a cast that includes The Foo Fighters, Kaiser Chiefs and a non-stop touring schedule. <br>With their new single ‘Bad Reality’ in the can and awaiting a final spit and polish before being unleashed, Stonefield are in game-on mode and busily preparing to tread the boards in a way that only they can! <br>The Bad Reality Tour will be a non-stop East Coast rock-and-roll rollercoaster ride that will see Stonefield headlining their handpicked support cast including up and coming garage dwellers The Delta Riggs and untamed Melbourne hair-waggers Kingswood. <br>It’s been nine months since their previous single, the triple j Hottest 100 entrant ‘Blackwater Rising’ first hit the airwaves, and ‘Bad Reality’ is due to tear your speakers apart when it’s released in a few weeks. <br>Recorded by Melbourne rock Svengali Lindsay Gravina at Birdland Studio (where Gravina helped craft seminal Australian rock records by The Living End, Spiderbait, Magic Dirt, Jet and British India) it is an organ fuelled tour-de-force led by the soulful growl of Amy Findlay over a foot stomping beat.

Мэдлиб не просто собирает записи — он их революционизирует. И тысячи альбомов, втиснутых в трёхкомнатное пространство, это не фетиш, а функциональные инструменты огромного оркестра Мэдлиба, каждая часть которого готова зазвучать, как только это понадобится дирижёру. Единственная присущая Мэдлибу константа состоит в том, что, не покладая рук и не смыкая глаз, он постоянно находится в работе. Помешанный на джазе он поглощён непрестанным творческим потоком, кажется, что написание новых битов для него — жизненно важный процесс, как прием пищи или дыхание для простых смертных. С ювелирной точностью, изяществом опытного хирурга и маниакальной усердностью обезумевшего профессора, Madlib вычленяет сэмплы из богом забытых мелодий и на их основе сочиняет совершенно новые композиции - всегда виртуозные и сочные, отчего по праву считается живым классиком современного битмейкинга. <br>16 октября Madlib выступит в Санкт — Петербурге в А2 при поддержке MC Фредди Гиббса (<a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Gibbs\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Freddie Gibbs</a>) и диджея Джея Рокка (<a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/J+Rocc\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">J Rocc</a>). <br>Так же, немаловажным фактом для оценки важности и актуальности этого концерта можно назвать и то, что Madlib едет в Россию впервые, и возможно — это единственный концерт здесь, который стоит у него в планах на ближайшие годы. <br>Откроет концерт вокальная группа <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/DedooX\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">DedooX</a> . Это шесть абсолютно разных в жизни, и единых в музыкальном направлении, людей. У всех участников богатое музыкальное сольное прошлое, и необъятное музыкально-экспериментальное будущее. Когда DedooX поют, у слушателей складывается ощущение, что они оказались внутри целого оркестра. "

В послужном списке ярчайшего представителя культового калифорнийского лейбла <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/label/Stones+Throw+Records\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_label\"\">Stones Throw Records</a> сотрудничество с несметным количеством артистов таких как: <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Erykah+Badu\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Erykah Badu</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/The+Alkaholiks\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">The Alkaholiks</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Mos+Def\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Mos Def</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/De+La+Soul\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">De La Soul</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Ghostface+Killah\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Ghostface Killah</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Talib+Kweli\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Talib Kweli</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/A.G.\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">A.G.</a>, <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/MF+DOOM\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">MF DOOM</a> (в дуэте они создали проект <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Madvillain\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Madvillain</a>) и <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/J+Dilla\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">J Dilla</a> (с ним был создан проект <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Jaylib\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Jaylib</a>). <br>Madlib по праву может считаться ходячей энциклопедией современной и не очень музыки — его фонотека винила давно уже исчисляется не количеством пластинок, а в весовых единицах - 4 тонны отборного материала со всех уголков земного шара. Мэдлиб не просто собирает записи — он их революционизирует. И тысячи альбомов, втиснутых в трёхкомнатное пространство, это не фетиш, а функциональные инструменты огромного оркестра Мэдлиба, каждая часть которого готова зазвучать, как только это понадобится дирижёру. Единственная присущая Мэдлибу константа состоит в том, что, не покладая рук и не смыкая глаз, он постоянно находится в работе. Помешанный на джазе он поглощён непрестанным творческим потоком, кажется, что написание новых битов для него — жизненно важный процесс, как прием пищи или дыхание для простых смертных. С ювелирной точностью, изяществом опытного хирурга и маниакальной усердностью обезумевшего профессора, Madlib вычленяет сэмплы из богом забытых мелодий и на их основе сочиняет совершенно новые композиции - всегда виртуозные и сочные, отчего по праву считается живым классиком современного битмейкинга. <br>16 октября Madlib выступит в Санкт — Петербурге в А2 при поддержке MC Фредди Гиббса (<a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/Freddie+Gibbs\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">Freddie Gibbs</a>) и диджея Джея Рокка (<a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/J+Rocc\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">J Rocc</a>). <br>Так же, немаловажным фактом для оценки важности и актуальности этого концерта можно назвать и то, что Madlib едет в Россию впервые, и возможно — это единственный концерт здесь, который стоит у него в планах на ближайшие годы. <br>Откроет концерт вокальная группа <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/music/DedooX\"\" class=\"\"bbcode_artist\"\">DedooX</a> . Это шесть абсолютно разных в жизни, и единых в музыкальном направлении, людей. У всех участников богатое музыкальное сольное прошлое, и необъятное музыкально-экспериментальное будущее. Когда DedooX поют, у слушателей складывается ощущение, что они оказались внутри целого оркестра. "

But the transcendent emotional and melodic heights achieved on the brilliantly titled tenth full-length Opeth album, Heritage, marks a new chapter in the storied quintet's career. Band leader, singer, guitarist, songwriter and long-running consistent member Mikael Åkerfeldt has reshaped the pathway forward for his artistic vehicle without sacrificing the hard won spiritualism of previous endeavors. <br>\"\"I’ve become synonymous with Opeth,\"\" he says, acknowledging his dedication to perfectionism and his studied decision making regarding the group's methodical and deliberate shifts. \"\"I’ve been writing the material since the first album. I’ve been steering the ship for many years now and I’m quite comfortable.

Ausgehend von der atmosphärischen Welt Schumanns, „von der Stimmung, aus der heraus Schumann gearbeitet hat“, hat er sich nun gefragt: Wie klingt Sehnsucht heute? Bei dem von ihm kuratierten dreiteiligen Konzert „The New Romantics” wird er gemeinsam mit anderen avantgardistischen Klangexperimentatoren der Schumannschen Empfindungswelt zeitgenössische Pendants, ,,ein ganz eigenes Genre“, zur Seite stellen. <br>Der Abend wird eröffnet von der jungen isländischen Sängerin und Multi-Instrumentalistin Ólöf Arnalds. „Irgendwo zwischen einem Kind und einer alten Dame” schwebt ihre Stimme, die häufig mit Björk verglichen wird. Klassisch auf der Geige ausgebildet, brachte Arnalds sich selbst das Spielen auf der Bratsche, Gitarre und dem Charango bei. Ihr Zugang zur Musik ist dennoch höchst individuell, verspielt und intim, zugleich mit einer zeitlosen Mystik versehen, die über die koboldhafte Unergründbarkeit ihrer Heimat hinausweist. Die New York Times beschreibt ihre Stimme als „hoch und klar, mit einem sanften Beben das ihre jenseitige Reinheit menschlich macht”. <br>Anschließend wird uns Hauschka gemeinsam mit dem finnischen Schlagzeuger Samuli Kosminen in eines seiner typischen Improvisations-Abenteuer für präpariertes Klavier und Schlagzeug entführen. Bei den melancholischen Miniaturen zwischen Weltschmerz und Daseinsbejahung, kombiniert mit den elektronischen Loops und Sounds von Kosminen, entstehen Stimmungen und zerfallen gleich wieder. <br>Ebenfalls für melancholischen Weltschmerz bekannt und für seine einzigartigen Grenzgänge zwischen Kammermusik und Rock, Klassik, Pop und zarter Elektronik ist der kanadische Pop-Star, „Zaubergeiger“ und Sänger Owen Pallett. Über eine fußbetriebene Loop Station kann er seine Violinklänge übereinanderschichten und zeitverzögert abspielen. Daraus entstehen berückend schöne, fein gesponnene Songs.

Un’attitudine assolutamente punk, al servizio di una scrittura scabra, rugginosa, confessionale e fortemente femminile. Quel che serve insomma. Rude e inattesa come come uno schiaffo in pieno volto, e poi improvvisamente leggera e melodiosa come la nostra bella canzone italiana. Il tutto senza filtro e con un talento descrittivo fuori dalle righe, Maria Antonietta racconta la giovinezza con un fragore generazionale che non lascia via di fuga. Urla e sussurra, Maria Antonietta, e ti tiene lì, legato al filo del suo immaginario nitido e potentissimo, fatto di fascinazione per l'universo sacro e di icone sante come ultimo baluardo di purezza incontaminata, di compulsioni e amori carnali senza condizioni. L' esordio in italiano per Picicca Dischi (registrato e prodotto da Dario Brunori), in uscita nel giorno dei natali di Giovanna d'Arco, la pucelle d'Orleans, è di un'urgenza dannata: massima brevità, quasi fossero. <br>MARCELLO E IL MIO AMICO TOMMASO <br>Marcello e il mio amico Tommaso sono in quattro - avete qualcosa in contrario? - e arrivano da Roma. <br>Una piccolissima orchestra pop da cameretta - violoncello, oboe, chitarra acustica, batteria, xilofono e due voci - cresciuta con il santino di Stephin Merritt nel portafoglio, una passione per le storie sbilenche degna del miglior Adam Green e un gusto per gli arrangiamenti dal sapore classico, ma immediato. <br>C'è Marcello che è alto alto e, quando non suona la chitarra elettrica nei Jacqueries, si trasforma in crooner romantico, ma in un modo tutto suo. <br>A fargli compagnia, ovviamente, il suo amico Tommaso. Violoncellista nell'orchestra del Teatro dell'Opera di Roma e nel Niabla Ensemble. <br>Sempre dalla musica classica arriva anche Gianlorenzo, anche lui nell'orchestra del Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, ma in veste di oboista (uno strumento sicuramente meno pesante del violoncello, ma altrettanto difficile da suonare). Poi c'è Margherita, che quando non recita in film, scrive e dirige cortometraggi, vince un sacco di premi e occupa famosi teatri di Roma, si siede dietro i tamburi e canta suonando la batteria. Come Phil Collins, ma con un taglio di capelli migliore. <br>\"\"Chounette\"\" è il loro primo EP, arriva alla fine dell'estate, quando le foglie cominciano a cadere e i bambini tornano a scuola. "

O repertório inclui músicas suas gravadas por outros intérpretes renomados como Maria Rita, Erasmo Carlos, Roberta Sá e Ivete Sangalo. Não ficam de fora músicas da antiga banda e da carreira individual de Camelo. Em comum, todas as canções são apresentadas em roupagem inédita e com a participação especial de um músico convidado. <br> \"\"Estou muito feliz de poder tocar neste formato”, diz Marcelo Camelo. “Para mim, vai ser muito desafiador em certo sentido, porque sempre construí minha obra baseado na instrumentação inteira, nas bandas com quem estive. Poder apresentar as músicas do jeito que elas nasceram, mais próximo possível de um formato unitário, me deixa muito animado.” <br> Marcelo Camelo transita entre estilos diversos, como MPB, rock e pop. Na década de 90 e 2000, fez muito sucesso como vocalista e guitarrista da banda Los Hermanos, com a qual gravou quatro discos (Los Hermanos, Bloco do Eu Sozinho, Ventura e 4). Em 2008, ele lançou seu primeiro disco solo, Sou. Já em abril de 2011, Marcelo lançou o seu segundo álbum solo, Toque Dela, em que nove das dez faixas foram compostas por ele. "

The album features production from The RZA, The Neptunes and Kanye's longtime collaborator Mike Dean. The short list of featured vocals includes Frank Ocean, Beyoncé, Curtis Mayfield and Mr. Hudson.

"Confusional Quartet","Shitdisco","Covo club","Dopo quasi 30 anni dal loro ultimo concerto a Bologna, tornano i Confusional Quartet con la loro formazione originale, una delle band più innovative che si siano mai viste nel nostro paese. Dopo di loro dj set dei fantastici Shitdisco! <br>Confusional Quartet <br>(Bologna – nowave pioniers) <br>Preparatevi per un live act bruciante, un’ora di energia allo stato puro per un quartetto fuori da ogni moda o schema musicale. Base ritmica poderosa, intrecci di synth e chitarre irriverenti e atonali, richiami a tradizione italica e futurismo, minimalismo e ironia. Questo il mix della musica che il gruppo bolognese propone dopo trent’anni di silenzio musicale. Come allora, quattro marziani scesi sulla terra per presentare una musica senza parole, senza intrattenimento. <br>Dopo una breve stagione all’inizio degli anni ’80 ed una manciata di dischi introvabili (ripubblicati nel 1999 e nel 2010) i quattro, nella formazione originale, si rimettono a suonare insieme e producono un Cd concept sperimentale – ITALIA CALIBRO X – in collaborazione con Gianni Gitti (Ansaldi Records) ed un Cd di inediti che uscirà in primavera mixato da Giulio Ragno Favero con un brano scritto insieme a Sir Cornelius Bob Rifo aka The Bloody Beetroots dove, ascoltandoli e comparandoli, si ha esattamente il quadro di cosa intendano i quattro per musica: sperimentazione e razionalità, improvvisazione e scrittura rigida, riflessione ed azione. <br>Durante il concerto verranno proposti tutti i brani inediti e soltanto quattro o cinque vecchie canzoni per ribadire, ce ne fosse bisogno, che il Confusional Quartet prosegue nella ricerca di nuove sonorità e situazioni musicali, in barba alle reunion nostalgiche. <br>special guest <br>SHITDISCO Dj Set <br>(UK – discopunk – Fierce Panda) <br>Gli Shitdisco sono un gruppo di Glasgow. Nati nel 2003, sono considerati, insieme ai Klaxons, i pionieri del nuovo genere che unisce sonorità disco, punk-rock e musica elettronica, definito New Rave. I primi due singoli, “Disco Blood” e “I Know Kung Fu” sono stati pubblicati nel dicembre 2005 e, dato il loro successo, hanno spinto la band a firmare un contratto con l’etichetta indipendente Fierce Panda Records. Il 16 aprile 2007 è uscito l’album del debutto sulla scena internazionale, Kingdom of Fear che, nella prima settimana, ha raggiunto il quarto posto nella classifica inglese degli album indie più venduti. <br>La campagna pubblicitaria 2008 della nota marca di birra Ceres, intitolata The True Heads, li vede come testimonial. Nello spot, la band si esibisce in una performance on stage della canzone “I Know Kung Fu”, davanti ad un pubblico di accaniti fan le loro teste sono tuttavia sostituite da una riproduzione in 3D. Il 23 settembre 2008 è uscito il secondo album di studio del gruppo, The Emanator, pubblicato solo per il mercato statunitense sull’etichetta di Steve Aoki, la Dim Mak Records. <br>Gli Shitdisco oggi non esistono più come band, ma proseguono la propria carriera infiammando i dancefloors di tutto il mondo con i loro clamorosi djsets. Due membri della band hanno formato un nuovo progetto, Age of Consent (live e dj set), di cui è in procinto di pubblicazione il primo singolo. <br>Ingresso concerto: 10 euro <br>Dopo il concerto: 7 euro, 5 in lista riduzione Tessera stagione 2011/12 HOVOC obbligatoria <br>Per riduzione post concerto scrivere il proprio nome, cognome e data cui si vuole partecipare a <a href=\"\"mailto:liste@covoclub.it\"\">liste@covoclub.it</a> <br>Apertura ore 22, chiusura ore 4. <br>More infos: <br><a href=\"\"http://www.facebook.com/events/373785472641299/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Facebook</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://covoclub.it/bo/shitdisco-dj-set-covo-club-bo/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Covo Club</a> "
"Jack White","Lanie Lane","Hordern Pavilion","Rock luminary JACK WHITE will be performing two headline shows in Melbourne and Sydney this July to showcase material from his much anticipated solo debut Blunderbuss (out 20 April through Sony). <br>Undoubtedly one of the world’s most prolific artists to emerge in the past fifteen years, Jack White has helmed some of the world’s most venerable musical outfits including The White Stripes, The Raconteurs and The Dead Weather. <br>The multitalented musician, eminent producer and successful label owner has taken home nine Grammys in seven different categories, proving his versatility and prowess within all endeavours. Blunderbuss is no exception. <br>The first single ‘Love Interruption’ from his most recent endeavour was quickly devoured and doted upon, as was follow up track ‘Sixteen Saltines’, leaving critics and fans hungry for more: <br>“Reminiscent of deeper cuts on the last few White Stripes albums, \"\"Love Interruption\"\" is an unusual but tantalizing lead track... Like the recent material from his other bands - and its title -- \"\"Love Interruption\"\" leaves you lusting for more.” – BILLBOARD <br>“...This project is designed to be bigger than anything he's done since the Stripes. Even more importantly than this, I've heard it three times and I can't get a second of it out of my head.” – NME <br>Jack White’s live show only adds to the sense of awe and reverence felt toward the Nashville resident. Those who made it into the showcase of White’s label Third Man Records during SXSW were treated to revamped hits as well as new material, all of which Australian fans can look forward to: <br>“What could have been White simply showcasing his new songs turned into a two-part, two-hour party featuring several White Stripes classics as well as tunes from his other projects the Raconteurs and his cinematic Danger Mouse/Daneile Luppi collaboration, Rome....proving yet again that he's an able, commanding helmsman no matter what ship he's steering.” – VARIETY <br>“A 90-minute set, which was easily the best live performance this writer has ever seen him play (White Stripes, Raconteurs, and Dead Weather all included)...Each song exploded to form a dazzling wall of sound, a level of intensity and vigor and perfection obtained by only the greats.” – CONSEQUENCE OF SOUND <br>Australia’s favourite rockabilly darling LANIE LANE will be joining Jack White on tour, having received his endorsement in the early stages of her career when she took him up on his offer to produce and release the single ‘Aint Hungry’ for Third Man Records. <br>Lanie Lane has since performed sold out shows of her own across the country and her debut album To The Horses (out now through Ivy League) has gained her devoted fans of her own upon its release late last year.

"The Rockingbirds","The Arlenes","Sticky Mike's Frog Bar","The Rockingbirds The short version of The Rockingbirds saga is that they released two acclaimed albums in the early 90s on the hip Heavenly label. They anticipated the alt-country revolution and sat comfortably alongside like-minded contemporaries like The Jayhawks and Uncle Tupelo. But, The Rockingbirds effectively burned out due to an over-enthusiastic lifestyle and imploded.  Reforming for their label, Heavenly Recordings, 18th birthday festival in London in 2008, The Rockingbirds played to packed Southbank audience. Since then the band’s first album has been re-mastered and re-released, and more live dates and fresh recording sessions are ensuing as The Rockingbirds try their method on a new generation. A new 7″ single “Till Something Better Comes Along” was released in December 2011 on Spring Records, and a new album is planned for 2012. To echo a line from their song Gradually Learning, being late is better than never. <br>support from Americana / Folk / Rock duo The Arlenes <br>The Arlenes are back in the UK after a 9 year ramble through the United States, from California to Nashville, TN. They sing close harmony acoustic music with a folk/country leaning, and have new album recorded in Tennessee for Loose Music. Friends of the Rockingbirds since the beginnings in Camden Town, The Arlenes are really looking forward to doing a few shows together again. "

"Josephine Foster","Victor Herrero","Cafe OTO","OTO favourite Josephine Foster is back for two nights with a full band on the back of her new album ‘Blood Rushing’ (Fire Records). Another welcome opportunity to experience Foster’s magnificent voice, swooping and swaying through the melodic arrangements (Morriconeon in their power and imagination) of her band. Some songs are singalongs, some are deep atmospheric tales that leave the listener yearning to know more. American gothic, breathless folk and mountain music are all drawn upon by the band but boy ‘o’ boy, do they swing and swing, with Spanish guitar maestro Victor Herrero channelling all kinds of colour and texture into proceedings. At the heart of the fulsome live sound which also features Trembling Bells’ Alex Neilson on drums and Paz Lenchantin from the Entrance Band on bass/violin will be Foster’s voice, evoking the nostalgic warmth and beauty of a phonograph. <br>‘Blood Rushing’ is an album that breathes new life into this old world: a celebration of myth making, with ancient images and themes of love, deserts and fire coursing through it like a river. A story within a story, the album is a glimpse into the world of Blushing, a heteronym of the artist Josephine Foster. A rock-ballet chante, the music is set to the meta-pulsing Pan— American heartbeat of the Pueblo drum. Recorded in Colorado by Andrija Tokic (Alabama Shakes) with the collaboration of her partner Victor Herrero, musical guests include Paz Lenchantin (The Entrance Band), Heather Trost (A Hawk and a Hacksaw) and Ben Trimble (Fly Golden Eagle).

No se los pueden perder, de verdad de la buena! <br>YOUTHLESS son Alex Klimovitsky (batería, sintetizador y voz) y Sebastián Ferranti (bajo y voz). Este dúo divide su tiempo entre Lisboa y Londres, donde grabaron su primer álbum, producido por Telemachy Rory Attwell de Test Icicles. Youthless son conocidos como los dos extranjeros, el estadounidense y el inglés, que no pueden vivir sin la costa portuguesa, desde que llevaron sus armas y maletas a Lisboa. <br>El uso de múltiples amplificadores utilizados al mismo tiempo, con diferentes sonidos, alternado con un pedal para simular diversos elementos, le da a la banda un estilo único e inconfundible que se ha convertido en una referencia entre la élite del rock de vanguardia escena de la dance / garage de Londres, Lisboa y Nueva York. <br>Youthless fueron elegidos “mejor banda nueva del 2011″ por el blog de Inglés ANBAD, elogiados por BBC1, Irish Times, NME, DIS, y fueron terceros en la lista de hits ‘del festival de renombre In The Cityde de Manchester. Algunos temas fueron remezclados por Olugbenga, bajista de Metronomy. <br>Youthless ha lanzado recientemente un nuevo single – Monsta – y se preparan para el lanzamiento de un álbum en el 2012. También fue una de las bandas que representó a Portugal en la 30 edición de la Semana de Música de Canadá y han pasado por PAREDES DE COURA 2012. "

"Poor Moon","Lovepark","The Lexington","Rockfeedback Concerts present… <br>POOR MOON <br>Poor Moon is a band comprised of longtime friends Christian Wargo, Casey Wescott, and brothers Ian and Peter Murray. And Poor Moon is the title of their full-length debut. But before there was a band or a record, there was the music, a series of songs forged by Christian Wargo over a period of several years. That's one of the things that makes Poor Moon sound so special: this band grew out of the songs, not vice-versa. <br>Thanks to their affinity for warm, earthy tones the music of Poor Moon can sound deceptively simple. Assorted timbres decorate these ten originals - marimba, harpsichord, fretless zither - but this isn't everything-but-the-kitchen-sink arranging. Whatever the instrumentation, the sense of choosing the right tool for the job always prevails. Thoughtful, impassioned vocal harmonies further reinforce the myriad musical bonds at play. <br>Poor Moon is released 27th August on Bella Union in the UK/Europe and Sub Pop in the US. <br>LOVEPARK <br>Lovepark are a guitar based band from Brighton via Burgess Hill, they met at their local skate park 6 years ago. They recently released a double A-side which includes the songs \"\"How Do I See?\"\" and \"\"Shudder\""
"MF DOOM","Jehst","HMV Forum","Soundcrash are very pleased to announce an exciting addition to the DOOM October 12th show, making for a night that is a heavyweight contender for hip hop show of the decade. Before DOOM takes to the stage the Californian DJ, multi-instrumentalist, rapper, and music producer MADLIB will present his Medicine Show Live for the first time in the UK alongside Freddie Gibbs and J Rocc. Plus live sets from Jneiro Jarel, Dels and Jehst and if that wasn’t enough the much in demand Kutmah and Illum Sphere will be providing the heat from the turntables. This is HUGE. <br>DOOM has previously worked under various pseudonyms including MF DOOM, VIKTOR VAUGHN, DANGER DOOM (with Danger Mouse) and MADVILLAIN (with Madlib). An essential and outlandish figure in underground hip hop, he always covers his face behind a Dr Doom mask and has created his own universe centered around the world of comic books and Japanese monsters. His unconventional approach, linguistic dexterity and sick flow have gained DOOM an army of ardent fans from many different corners of the music world, and counts musicians of the caliber of Thom Yorke as some of his biggest supporters. His next album is a collaboration with Jneiro Jarel under the name JJ DOOM titled ‘KEY TO THE KUFFS‘. (Lex Records, August 21st). <br>Madlib certainly doesn’t require an introduction. One of the most prolific artists in hip hop, Madlib has been a man of many aliases beginning his music career in the early 1990’s. Releasing his first proper album as Madlib in 2002, setting himself apart with his future thinking and individual approach to production. A year later he teamed up with the late hip hop producer J Dilla, cementing the duo’s project Jaylib to wide acclaim. During this period Madlib also collaborated with a myriad other world renowned hip hop artists including Mos Def, De La Soul, Ghostface Killah and Talib Kweli. In 2004 he partnered up with DOOM to record ‘Madvillainy’ making for one hip hop’s most influential albums of recent years. Bringing us to today where Madlib can be found regular collaborating with the likes of Erykah Badu and Joyce Moreno. On October 12th Madlib will be joined on stage with the dynamic MC and long term collaborator Freddie Gibbs to present his Medicine Show exclusively for Soundcrash. <br>Age restrictions - 18+ <br>PRESENTED BY SOUNDCRASH "

There's three music areas over the 5000+ capacity site, plus more non-music features still to be announced. <br>As well as being a record shop, we at Banquet Records are a concert promoter throughout the year (last year alone we put on over 200 shows!). We've been looking to do something festival-like, like this, for years. After many false starts with potential locations in and around Kingston, we've found the perfect site to put on some of our favourite bands, from the different music worlds that Banquet loves. The grounds are excellent, the staging and the PA are everything we could have hoped for, the parking and travel links are bang on. Unlike anywhere in Kingston, the alcohol licensing rules are such that there'll be no restrictions for over 18s to have a beer in the sun and watch some great bands, whilst people of all ages are invited to come to the festival.  <br>Full information of the event can be found at <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/out?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.banquetsbigdayout.com%2F\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.banquetsbigdayout.com/</a> "

The grounds are excellent, the staging and the PA are everything we could have hoped for, the parking and travel links are bang on. Unlike anywhere in Kingston, the alcohol licensing rules are such that there'll be no restrictions for over 18s to have a beer in the sun and watch some great bands, whilst people of all ages are invited to come to the festival.  <br>Full information of the event can be found at <a href=\"\"http://www.last.fm/out?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.banquetsbigdayout.com%2F\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.banquetsbigdayout.com/</a> "

"Evanescence","The Used","Espaço das Américas","Turnê mundial do novo álbum da banda, “Evanescence”, chega ao país em outubro para apresentações no Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Recife e Fortaleza  <br>A apresentação no Rio de Janeiro fará parte do projeto “Live Music Rocks” <br>Considerada uma das mais populares bandas de rock surgidas neste século, o Evanescence está de volta ao país. Os norte-americanos chegam ao Brasil em outubro com a turnê de seu mais recente álbum, o homônimo “Evanescence”, para apresentações no Rio de Janeiro, dia 06, na HSBC Arena, dentro do projeto Live Music Rocks no dia 07 em São Paulo, no Espaço das Américas dia 11 será a vez de Recife e no dia 13 estarão em Fortaleza. A banda norte-americana The Used fará os shows de abertura. <br>O Evanescence já ganhou dois prêmios Grammy e vendeu cerca de 25 milhões de cópias de seus cinco álbums. A popularidade da banda junto ao público, que adora seus clipes, sempre nos primeiros lugares da MTV, ganhou contextos de discussão junto à crítica especializada, que luta para classificar o som da banda: seria puramente metal, ou new metal, ou gothic metal ? Para eles, chegou-se até a criar um novo rótulo, o “nu metal“. Na opinião da crítica, são questões comuns quando se trata de uma banda que adota um estilo inovador. <br>Os ingressos estarão a venda a partir do dia 16 de agosto para a apresentação em São Paulo e a partir do dia 18 de agosto para a apresentação no Rio de Janeiro. <br>EVANESCENCE <br>O Evanescence é uma banda norte-americana de rock formada em 1995 na cidade de Little Rock pela vocalista e pianista Amy Lee a formação original ainda contava com o guitarrista Ben Moody, que hoje deixou o grupo. Atualmente o grupo tem cinco integrantes: Amy Lee, Terry Balsamo, Tim McCord, Will Hunt e Troy McLawhorn. <br>O Evanescence era popular na região de Little Rock, tocando em bares e casas noturnas. Os primeiros materiais da banda são os EPs “Evanescence” (1998) e “Sound Asleep” (1999), dos quais todas as cópias foram vendidas e porisso extremamente raras em todo o mundo. Porém a banda só ganhou fama e reconhecimento mundial no ano de 2003 com o álbum “Fallen” que recebeu sete vezes disco de platina pela RIAA, além de vender mais de 17 milhões de cópias em todo o mundo, ajudando a banda a vencer dois Grammys. <br>O álbum ao vivo “Anywhere but Home” (2004) foi gravado em Paris, alavancando o sucesso internacional da banda, principalmente na Europa. Durante 2003, o single “Bring Me to Life” permaneceu por semanas no topo das paradas musicais, tornando-se o maior hit da banda até então a canção ainda entrou para a trilha sonora do filme “Daredevil”. Em outubro de 2003, o guitarrista Ben Moody anuncia sua saída do Evanescence em meio à turnê “Fallen Tour”, alegando diferenças criativas com os outros membros da banda. <br>O segundo álbum de estúdio, “The Open Door” (2006) trouxe de volta a banda após dois anos de hiato. O disco vendeu cerca de 6 milhões de cópias em todo o mundo. Após a turnê “The Open Door Tour” em 2007, o guitarrista John LeCompt e o bateirista Rocky Gray deixam a banda. Com isso restam apenas Lee e Balsamo, já que Will Boyd também deixara a banda em meados de 2006. <br>O terceiro disco de estúdio, o auto-intitulado “Evanescence” (2011) debutou em primeiro lugar na Billboard 200, e vendeu mais de meio milhão de cópias em apenas um mês, sendo recebido com entusiasmo pela crítica e pelos fãs da banda. Foram lançados até então três singles deste novo trabalho: “What You Want”, “My Heart Is Broken” e “Lost in Paradise”. <br>DISCOGRAFIA <br>2000 – Origin <br>2003 – Fallen <br>2004 – Anywhere But Home <br>2006 – The Open Door <br>2011 – Evanescence <br>Site oficial: <a href=\"\"http://www.evanescence.com\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.evanescence.com</a> <br>THE USED <br>Composta por Bert McCracken nos vocais, Quinn Allman na guitarra, Jepha Howard no baixo e Dan Whitesides na bateria, o The Used é uma banda norte-americana de post-hardcore formada na cidade de Orem, no estado de Utah, em 2001. O embrião da banda surgiu em outubro de 1999, quando Quinn com amigos formaram uma banda chamada Dumb Luck. Gravaram um EP, mas não obtiveram sucesso. Começaram então a fazer testes para encontrar um vocalista que se encaixasse perfeitamente no contexto da banda. Bert era conhecido de Quinn e foi convidado a se juntar a eles. Em Janeiro de 2001 a banda estava oficialmente formada e tinha um novo nome – Used. Enviaram a música “Box Full Of Sharp Objects” para John Feldmann, que a achou genial e logo quis iniciar um projeto com a banda. Gravaram então um EP e consequentemente assinaram contrato com a gravadora Reprise Records, quando tiveram de mudar o nome de Used para The Used por causa de uma banda de Boston que já havia patenteado o nome. Em 2002 lançaram o CD “The Used”, e com ele fizeram várias turnês pelo mundo – a principal delas, “Warped Tour”, conquistando cada vez mais fãs. No ano seguinte, após o grande sucesso de vendas, lançaram um CD/DVD contendo sua história – “Maybe Memories”, seguido de “In Love In Death”, também produzido por John Feldmann. <br>Em 2005, o The Used liderou a turnê “Taste Of Chaos”, juntamente com outras bandas, entre elas a My Chemical Romance, de quem se tornam íntimos. Juntos fizeram um cover da música “Under Pressure”, originalmente da banda Queen e de David Bowie. Depois de um ano de férias, em agosto de 2006, foi anunciada a saída de seu baterista original, Branden Steineckert. O motivo nunca foi revelado e o posto foi ocupado por Dan Whitesides (ex-integrante da banda New Transit Direction). Em 2007 o The Used lança um novo DVD, e em seguida, um novo álbum. Continuam liderando a “Taste Of Chaos”, desta vez ao lado das bandas 30 Seconds To Mars e Senses Fail, entre outros. O CD “Lies For The Liars”, logo chegaria aos primeiros lugares dos álbuns mais vendidos na Billboard. Em dezembro de 2007, a banda realizou sua primeira turnê pelo Brasil, apresentando-se no Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo e Curitiba. Lançou ainda mais três álbuns – o EP “Shallow Believer” de 2008, “ Artwork” de 2009 e o mais recente “Vulnerable” de 2012. <br>Site Oficial: theused.net <br>CLASSIFICAÇÃO ETÁRIA: 16 anos <br>Pista Premium R$ 340,00(inteira) R$ 170,00 (meia) <br>Pista R$ 180,00 (inteira) R$ 90,00 (meia) <br>Horário abertura portões: 18h00 <br>The Used: 20h00 <br>Evanescence: 21h00 "

"Jelonek","Leash Eye","Stodoła","W rockowym i rock metalowym brzmieniu Jelonka widoczny jest duży wpływ muzyki klasycznej (m.in. Vivaldiego, Paganiniego czy Rossiniego). <br>Podczas koncertu oprócz autorskich kompozycji z pewnością nie zabraknie coverów utworów takich artystów, jak m.in.: Metallica, Judas Priest, Jimi Hendrix. Będą one prezentowane w oryginalnych aranżacjach z przełożeniem głównego ciężaru wykonawczego na skrzypce klasyczne i elektryczne. <br>Michał Jelonek jest prawdziwą sceniczną bestią. To ekspresyjny muzyk z dużą dozą poczucia humoru. Możecie być pewni, że podczas występu nie zabraknie spontanicznej „bieganiny”, „chorych” choreografii, punkowego „gibania się”, scenicznych fajerwerków, demonicznych atrakcji oraz mrocznych niespodzianek. Jego występy zachwycają zarówno fanów klasyki, muzyki rockowej, jak i innych nurtów muzycznych. <br>Michał Jelonek - muzyk – instrumentalista, specjalizacja - skrzypce. <br>Nagrał ponad 20 albumów współautorskich i ponad 40 albumów gościnnie (muzyka klasyczna, pop, r'n'b, folk, rock i metal). Wygrał wiele konkursów i festiwali m.in. Jarocin 93, Złoty Bączek Przystanek Woodstock i inne. Kilkakrotnie wytypowany na jednego z najlepszych instrumentalistów polskich (1993 - magazyn „Tylko Rock”, 1994 - Siedlce „Rock 94”, 2008 – „Scyzoryki”, 2008 - magazyn „Teraz Rock” i inne). Wraz z zespołem „Ankh” otrzymał nagrodę Ministra Kultury i Dziedzictwa Narodowego „Zasłużony dla Kultury Polskiej”. <br>W okresie od 1993 do 2010r. zagrał około 1600 koncertów w Polsce a także w Brazylii, Czechach, Estonii, Litwie, Łotwie, Meksyku, Niemczech, Rosji, Słowacji, Szwecji, Szwajcarii i na Ukrainie. Nagrywa i tworzy muzykę filmową, a także muzykę do reklam. Współpracuje lub współpracował z takimi zespołami jak: Ankh, Closterkeller, De Press, Firebirds, Freak of Nature, Grejfrut, Hunter, Kasa, Lizar, Łzy, Mafia, Maybe-b, Orkiestra Dni Naszych, Perfect, Szwagierkolaska, Teatr Kobiet, Tosteer, T-Raperzy znad Wisły, Wilki i inne, oraz z artystami: Maryla Rodowicz, Ilona Sojda, Wojciech Gąsowski, Stan Borys, Paulla i inni. <br>Od 2007 roku koncertuje również ze swoim solowym projektem „Jelonek”. <br>Jesienią 2011 ukazał się najnowszy album Jelonka. <br>Support:Leash Eye <br>Członkowie Leash Eye nazywają obecnie swoją muzykę Hard Truckin' Rock, a w praktyce jest to mieszanka dużej ilości melodyjności hard rocka rodem z lat 70-tych oraz elementów stoner-metalu czy też southern rocka. Brzmienie zespołu to osadzona sekcja rytmiczna wzbogacona o mięsiste gitary oraz przesterowane organy Hammonda. To wszystko okraszone niebanalnym, typowo hard-rockowym wokalem daje mieszankę klasyfikującą muzykę Leash Eye w kategoriach hard rocka na miarę XXI wieku. <br>Skład: <br>Łukasz 'Konar' Konarski - perkusja <br>Marek 'Marecki' Kowalski - gitara basowa <br>Piotr 'Voltan' Sikora - organy <br>Arkadiusz 'Opath' Gruszka - gitary <br>Sebastian 'Sebb' Pańczyk – wokal <br>Dyskografia: <br>1999 - Demo CD (5 utworów) <br>2006 - Promo CD (3 utwory) <br>2009 - V.E.N.I (Metal Mundus Records) <br>2010 - From Hell To Wyoming(2 utwory) <br>2011 - V.I.D.I (Metal Mind Productions) <br>Najważniejsze wydarzenia i osiagniecia w 2011 roku: <br>- zwycięstwo w prestiżowym konkursie Antyradia - 'Antyfest' <br>- występ na Sonisphere Festival u boku Iron Maiden i Motorhead <br>- występ na największym metalowym festiwalu na świecie Wacken Open Air, jako reprezentant Polski wyłoniony w drodze konkursu Wacken Metal Battle <br>- podpisanie umowy wydawniczej na druga płytę zespołu V.I.D.I z Metal Mind Productions <br>Płyta została przyjęta bardzo dobrze przez słuchaczy oraz krytyków, czego dowodem są entuzjastyczne recenzje w najważniejszych magazynach muzycznych oraz serwisach internetowych jak również obecność nagrań zespołu w ogólnopolskich rozgłośniach radiowych(m.in.

"Radiohead","Caribou","Ziggo Dome","UITVERKOCHT <br>Op zondag 14 oktober geeft Radiohead een concert in de Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam. Radiohead heeft vanaf begin jaren negentig acht albums uitgebracht en wereldwijd meer dan 25 miljoen platen verkocht en een groot aantal hits gescoord zoals wereldhit Creep welke later door de band werd verguisd, Paranoid Android, Street Spirit (Fade Out), Pyramid Song, Karma Police en veel meer. <br>De band rond frontman Thom Yorke, Johnny Greenwood, Ed O´Brien, Colin Greenwood en Phil Selway is vaak in het nieuws door hun opvallende acties met betrekking tot het uitbrengen van muziek. In 2007 kwam dat vooral door de downloadversie van het toen verschenen album In Rainbows, waarbij de koper zelf kon bepalen wat hij wilde betalen voor het album. In 2011 verscheen The King of Limbs op een eveneens opvallende manier, eerst digitaal, toen op cd en vinyl en later als eerste ‘newspaper album’. <br>Caribou zal het voorprogramma verzorgen. Caribou combineert elektronische muziek met indierock en jazz en brak door met zijn Up in Flames-album uit 2003. Onder de naam Manitoba bracht Caribou meerdere albums uit met elektronische muziek. Later veranderde hij zijn naam, maar zijn muziek bleef een intelligente mix van de jaren zestig sound, moderne elektronica en bezwerende vocalen. <br>Aanvangstijden (onder voorbehoud) <br>Deuren open: 18.30 uur  <br>Aanvang Caribou: 19.30 uur  <br>Aanvang Radiohead: 20.30 uur "

"Beth Jeans Houghton","Driver Drive Faster","King's College London Student Union KCLSU","BETH JEANS HOUGHTON & THE HOOVES OF DESTINY <br>\"\"Yours Truly, Cellophane Nose\"\" introduces one of the most self-assured new artists of the year, a pop polymath whose blend of psychedelia, glam rock and chain gang folk is quite unlike anything else you’re likely to hear in 2012. Like her utterly unique stage outfits, it’s made from disparate individual elements that wouldn’t work on paper, but sing out like a holy choir in the execution. <br>Adding muscle to Beth’s far-ranging vocals are her band The Hooves Of Destiny. Comprising Dav Shiel (drums, vocals samples), Rory Gibson (bass, vocals), Ed Blazey (guitar, trumpet, vocals) and Findlay Macaskill (violin, vocals), they’re a crack unit recruited from Beth’s native North East. <br>Songs about boys and dreams have never sounded so forceful and proud as these, and there’s plenty more to unpick in Beth’s hugely inventive lyrics. Having recorded the album without a record deal to ensure complete creative control, it will be released on Mute, the label described by Houghton as \"\"The one that still believed in my record after everyone else had gone to the pub.\"\" Now ready for release, Beth sees the album as \"\"an animal I'm preparing to ride. Grooming it, feeding it, braiding its hair, and I feel that Ben has built me a saddle that is both practical and comfortable to use. And because of this I feel confident in its release.\"\" <br>DRIVER DRIVE FASTER <br>Driver Drive Faster are a band from Manchester, but you wouldn’t necessarily tell: theirs is a timeworn sound that exists somewhere between Americana and spectral indie rock. It’s crafted song-writing at its best, hinging on stirring chord sequences and moments of fragile beauty. <br>Taking their name from the first line in WH Auden’s poem Calypso, in which he’s running late to meet his lover, Driver Drive Faster comprise Dylan and Japan-born bassist Yuri Caul, who met at school in Torquay, Devon, plus Durham-born Peet Earnshaw and German drummer David Schlechtriemen. <br>Following 2011’s supremely well-received debut album Open House, Driver Drive Faster are set to return with a brand new single, aptly named \"\"To Return\"\" and aptly sounding like the work of a band brimming with confidence and good feeling.

"Eagles of Death Metal","DIRTY & THE GIRL SCOUTS","Lido","EAGLES OF DEATH METAL <br>Mit den Eagles Of Death Metal leben Queens Of The Stone Age-Chef Josh Homme und Frontmann Jesse ‚The Devil’ Hughes ihren Rock’n’Roll-Traum. Dank klassischer, tanzbarer Songs und grandioser Shows gehören sie zu den besten Live-Acts überhaupt. Nachdem Jesse Hughes im vergangenen Jahr mit seinem Electro-Rock’n’Roll-Projekt Boots Electric sowohl live als auch im Studio überzeugte, kehrt er jetzt mit den Eagles Of Death Metal zurück auf die Konzertbühnen. Der erste Deutschland-Gig ihrer Tournee zum letzten Album „Heart On“ von 2009 ist ein exklusives Showcase am 18. Juni in Berlin. <br>Es begann mit einer Idee der einstigen Schulfreunde Joshua Homme – Frontmann der Queens Of The Stone Age – und Sänger/Gitarrist Jesse ‚The Devil’ Hughes. 1998 gründeten die beiden in ihrem Heimatort Palm Desert in der kalifornischen Wüste die Eagles Of Death Metal – zunächst nur, weil ihnen der Name gut gefiel. Die großartige Musik dahinter, eine infektiöse Mischung aus Boogie, Rock und Blues, entstand erst später. Diese ungewöhnliche Basis ließ die Eagles Of Death Metal zu einer der besten Rockbands des Planeten reifen. <br>Mit den Alben „Peace Love Death Metal“ (2004), „Death By Sexy“ (2006) und „Heart On“ (2009) sowie einem fast übermenschlichen Live-Pensum erarbeiteten sich die Eagles Of Death Metal eine stetig wachsende Fangemeinde. Ihre Konzerte mutierten zu ausgelassenen Rock-Happenings inklusive Posen, Schweiß und Luftgitarren. Hits wie „Cherry Cola“, „I Want You So Hard (Boy’s Bad News)“ oder „Wannabe In L.A.” dominierten auch den Mainstream. In Modekampagnen oder in Werbespots zur letzten Fußball-EM – überall taucht der Name Eagles Of Death Metal auf. <br>„Heart On“ feierte weltweit Erfolge, in den USA erreichte es Platz 3 der Independent Album Charts. Die weltweiten Tourneen entwickelten sich zum echten Szenetipp. Dennoch legte Jesse Hughes seine Adler vorübergehend auf Eis, um mit seinem Nebenprojekt Boots Electric zu reüssieren. Womit ihm auf Anhieb eine Sensation gelang, denn seine Mischung aus Boogie und knackiger Elektronik stieß überall auf große Anerkennung. <br>Nun kommt er mit den Eagles Of Death Metal zurück, die neben Hughes aktuell aus seinen prominenten Mitstreitern Dave Catching (Gitarre, Ex-Queens Of The Stone Age), Abby Travis (Bass) und Queens Of The Stone Age-Schlagzeuger Joey Castillo bestehen. Ob man auf ihrem ersten Deutschland-Konzert seit 2009 auch neue Songs hören wird, ist noch offen – ebenso wie die Frage, wann ein neues Album erscheint. Absolut sicher ist hingegen, dass die Band ihrem Ruf als eine der heißesten und unterhaltsamsten Live-Rock-Acts der Gegenwart erneut gerecht werden wird. <br><a href=\"\"http://www.eaglesofdeathmetal.net\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.eaglesofdeathmetal.net</a> <br><a href=\"\"https://www.facebook.com/eaglesofdeathmetal\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">https://www.facebook.com/eaglesofdeathmetal</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.myspace.com/eaglesofdeathmetal\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.myspace.com/eaglesofdeathmetal</a> <br>DIRTY & THE GIRL SCOUTS <br>\"\"dirty & the girl scouts\"\" hit the scene in 2011 with their explosive brand of loud arrogant rock-n-roll. <br>drinking from the pools of rock, post-punk, garage, & prog, the result is a dangerous cocktail- the musicianship is too smart to be simply filed under punk, and the attitude/energy is way too much for the safety of the straight rock category today. <br>the wild intensity and passion of their live shows has earned them a reputation as crazy mofos kicking out the badass jams. formed in berlin, the band is an international mix of troublemakers- an israeli guitarrorist, a drummer from venezuela, a bass player from argentina and a california loudmouth. <br>together they're on a mission to smash their various influences into the loudest sweatiest sonic dynamite possible….\"\" -jimi hentai 2012 <br><a href=\"\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dirty-the-Girl-Scouts/205728449452292\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dirty-the-Girl-Scouts/205728449452292</a> "

Całość sprawia, że muzyka Hellhaven wyrasta ponad przeciętność.\"\" <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>-------------------------------------------------------------------- <br>Krakon (<a href=\"\"http://krakon.irpg.pl/2012/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://krakon.irpg.pl/2012/</a>): <br>Ogólnopolski zlot miłośników fantastyki „Krakon” po raz pierwszy zorganizowano w roku 1993. Od samego początku należał do najlepszych imprez tego typu w Polsce. Gromadził on setki uczestników, a kilkukrotnie ich liczba przekroczyła okrągły tysiąc. Po trzyletniej przerwie „Krakon” powrócił w zupełnie nowej odsłonie. Tym razem swoją ofertę kierując nie tylko do wspomnianych miłośników fantastyki, ale również otworzył swoje wrota dla fascynatów szeroko rozumianej kultury i sztuki japońskiej, z mangą i anime na czele. Decyzja ta była podyktowana szybkim rozwojem rynku Mangi i Anime w Polsce. Na który i My organizatorzy zwróciliśmy uwagę. Impreza zgromadziła ponad 1400 uczestników i pomimo niedociągnięć ze strony organizacyjnej bawili się oni przez cale cztery dni trwania konwentu. <br>W tym roku znów powracamy w nowej Przygodowo-podróżniczej odsłonie. Zgromadzimy Was na naszym Krakowskim Safari by zapewnić Wam trzy dni rozrywki w klimatach Przygód na Czarnym Lądzie. <br>W programie imprezy przewidziane zostały tak jak wcześniej różnorodne bloki tematyczne: Blok RPG, Fantastyczny, Blok szeroko pojętej kultury Japońskiej, Blok Autorski, Blok Larpowy, Blok Twórczości Terry’ego Pratchetta, Blok podróżniczy który jest perełką tegorocznej edycji oraz wiele, wiele więcej. <br>Wszystkie bloki programowe otrzymają swoje „5 minut” wraz z towarzyszącymi im cyklami konkursów, które będą aktywne przez cały czas trwania festiwalu. <br>Obowiązkową atrakcją będzie Cosplay cieszący się sławą na całym świecie, czyli turniej strojów. <br>Nie zapomnimy także o ludziach, którzy odnajdują swoją pasję w grach planszowych, fabularnych, multimedialnych czy też karcianych. <br>W trakcie imprezy każdy będzie miał możliwość skorzystania ze specjalnie zorganizowanej sali, zapewniającej komfort graczom wielbiącym plansze.

"Crazy Arm","Apologies, I Have None","Musikbunker","APOLOGIES, I HAVE NONE! (uk) <br>Apologies, i have none ist für nicht wenige Musikfreunde eine der besten europäischen Bands des Jahres. Für Fans anspruchsvollem Pop-Punks mit Heartcore-Kante ist diese Band ein Must-Have in der Schnittmenge aus den Menzingers, Flatliners, Iron Chic bis hin zu Against Me - natürlich gepaart mit britischem Charme & Akzent.Das Debüt \"\"LONDON\"\" der in England schon groß gefeierten Combo ist vor kurzem beim deutschen Label Uncle M erschienen. Der in der Info verwendete Begriff Heartc <br>ore, trifft es dabei ziemlich gut. Mit ihrem emolastigen Punkrock, der immer wieder von eingängigen Indie-Strukturen durchzogen ist, packen die vier Jungs vom ersten bis zum letzten Song und lassen die Emotionen walten. Dabei sorgt der kantige Punk-Kern dafür, dass der Sound nicht zu glatt wirkt. <br>CRAZY ARM (uk) <br>Mit ihrem feinsinnigem Mix aus Against Me meets Bruce Springsteen oder Fugazi meets The Clash klingen Crazy Arm aus Plymouth nach wie vor etwas frischer als die Referenzband des Genres - Gasliht Anthem - und auch immer einen Tick experimentierfreudiger. Gelegentlich weichen die Briten sogar von dem Schmuse-Punkflair ab um treibenderen Momenten den Vorrang zu lassen. Dazu kommt die richtige Attitüde, die sich durch die immer präsenten politischen Anliegen bemerkbar macht. <br>Sie machen auch Halt in Aachen! <br><a href=\"\"http://www.facebook.com/thecrazyarm\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.facebook.com/thecrazyarm</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://apologiesihavenone.co.uk/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://apologiesihavenone.co.uk/</a>  <a href=\"\"http://www.facebook.com/apologiesihavenone\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.facebook.com/apologiesihavenone</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.musikbunker-aachen.de\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.musikbunker-aachen.de</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.facebook.com/herzblut.booking\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.facebook.com/herzblut.booking</a> "

"Two Days Left","To Heaven Earth Is Hell","Perron55","Two Days Left is een jonge band uit Venlo en Eindhoven. Zij staan voor verfrissende metalcore waarin hoekige riffs samen gaan met melodische soundscapes. Een mengeling van invloeden als The Chariot, Deftones en Norma Jean met electronica in de stijl van Enter Shikari. Two Days Left is klaar om elk podium te bestormen met hun energieke show. 2011 was een bewogen jaar voor de band. In maart miste ze op een haar na een plek op Pinkpop, door een tweede plaats te behalen met Nu Of Nooit. In september werd de eerste EP gereleased in een vrijwel uitverkocht Perron55. Aaneensluitend volgde een release tour en reisde de band mee tijdens de landelijke Popronde. <br>Eind 2011 kreeg de band met meer dan 2000 stemmen de titel \"\"Local Hero 2011\"\" vanuit popmagazine LiveXS. 2012 ging hierdoor knallend van start door een plek te hebben op het Eurosonic/Noorderslag festival. Nu zijn ze terug op het podium van Perron 55 om opnieuw te knallen en te laten zien wat ze waard zijn. <br>Support: <br>FaceCrusher is een jonge band die in 2009 startte met vijf bandleden. Een van de mannen is inmiddels gestopt en de andere bandleden maken nummers die zich het beste laten omschrijven als (trash) metal. Inmiddels laat de band een mooie mix horen van covers en eigen nummers. Geïnspirieerd door Slayer, Exodus, Metallica, Agnostic Front en nog veel meer. <br>To Heaven Earth Is Hell ontstond medio 2010 en timmeren inmiddels hard aan de weg. Met muzikale invloeden uit allerlei hoeken varieert hun sound van metalcore tot hardcore en een snufje deathcore. "

"Juke Joint Pimps","Fast Eddy Wilkinson","Merlin","Die wilde, rohe Energie des frühen elektrischen Blues und der anarchische Humor der zwei Freaks vereinen die Genrelager. Die Juke Joint Pimps spielen Juke Joint Blues: ungehobelt, krachig, auf die Zwölf – so wie er wohl einst aus den schwarzen Spelunken von West Memphis dröhnte. Klänge von Hound Dog Taylor, Howlin´Wolf und dem North Mississippi Hill Country Blues verschmelzen zu einem unwiderstehlichen, leicht entflammbaren, tiefschwarzen Gebräu. 2009 wurden die Pimps für die deutsche Endausscheidung der International Blues Challenge auserkoren. <br>Die Juke Joint Pimps sind: <br>Mighty Mike (Voc.,harp, drums) und T-Man (guitar) <br>Fast Eddy Wilkinson <br>Die Stuttgarter Bluesröhre mit britischem Pass heute im Solo-Auftritt. Neben eigenen Songs bringt Eddy bluesaffine Cover-Songs der 60er und 70er Jahre, u.a. von Sam Cooke, den Rolling Stones und Bob Dylan – interpretiert auf seine eigene typische Art. <br><a href=\"\"http://www.juke-joint-pimps.com\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.juke-joint-pimps.com</a> "

"Cloud-Messenger","Jasper Kuipers","Plaza Futura","Cloud-Messenger (wolkbode) <br>Struggle against loneliness <br>Cloud Messenger is een avondvullend cross-mediaproject over de invloeden van eenzaamheid op de menselijke psyche. De bron tot inspiratie ligt bij het mythische gedicht Meghadūta van de 5e-eeuwse Sanskriet-dichter Kālidāsa. In dit werk wordt de hoofdpersonage, een goddelijke dienaar, door straf verbannen van zijn geliefde. Na vele maanden eenzaamheid smeekt hij een passerende wolk om zijn boodschap over te brengen. <br>De Russisch-Nederlandse componist Fred Momotenko vertolkt samen met choreograaf Hans Teurlings en animator Jasper Kuipers de overpeinzingen van die mytische Yaksha en de reis die de Wolk via de illusionaire dwalingen doormaakt. Gevoelens als passie, hoop, vertwijfeling en opstandigheid zijn aanwezig in alle personages.  <br>Deze voorstelling is een multimediale ontmoeting van een blokfluitist en een danser geplaatst temidden van ruimtelijk geprojecteerde animaties met een virtuele danseres gecombineerd met brede electro-akoestische klanken. De inhoud van het geheel bruist van vele gemoedstoestanden van de oorspronkelijke karakters, en door de choreografie van Hans Tuerlings, de klei animaties van Jasper Kuipers en compositie van Fred Momotenko vormt het een nieuw poëtisch en tegelijkertijd een zeer actueel tafereel.

"Paatos","A Liquid Landscape","The Rock Temple","Verleden jaar maakte de Zweedse art-rock band PAATOS een geweldige comeback met het adembenemende album Breathing. Dit jaar zullen ze eindelijk weer te zien zijn op de podia verspreid over heel Europa, samenvallend met wederom een nieuw album. <br>De band maakte hooge kwalitatieve albums in het verleden, waaronder Kallocain, gemixed door Steven Wilson. In de jaren 2004-2007 trad PAATOS vaak op en ging op tour met The Gathering en Porcupine Tree. <br>In Oktober zal het nieuwe album, dat nieuwe, maar ook oude nummers in een ander arrangement opgenomen bevat, uitkomen op het Nederlandse label Glassville Records. Er zijn verschillende vinyl release voor het najaar gepland, welke leiden tot de tour die in November zal starten. Ze worden begeleid door 2 veelbelovende bands. <br>A LIQUID LANDSCAPE (NL) brachten hun debut album Nightingal Express uit in het begin van dit jaar. Het is een concept album, dat regisseur Lex Vesseur ertoe inspireerde om een kort film te maken met muziek van dat album. Hij maakt ook het art-work en de visuele effecten voor de live show. Het album werd gemixed door Forrester Savell (Helmet, Karnivool). Beiden, het album en de live shows, krijgen uitstekende recensies. Deze gepassioneerde muziek in de trend van Karnivool, Anathema en Porcupine Tree. <br>THE SIXXIS zullen de avond beginnen met hun opwindende rock nummers. De band heeft zojuist een EP opgenomen die in de herfst zal uitkomen. Ze maken zich klaar om met de beroemde band VOLBEAT op pad te gaan in de VS. Resonant en donderend, hun muziek hoort zich aan als een storm die zich in de verte aankondigd. <br>Een korte historie. <br>PAATOS werd opgericht in het jaar 2000 en begon als rhythm sectie voor de Zweedse Folk Rock zanger Turid. Dit ontstak het vuurtje en al gauw kwam Petronella bij de band als zangeres en celliste. Orginele composities begonnen al snel vorm aan te nemen. <br>Timeloss was het eerste studio-album van de band en werd oorspronkelijk op het label van Stockholm Records uitgebracht in 2002 en op het Inside Out label als re-issue in 2005, samen met 2 bonus songs en een video. <br>Het album van PAATOS uit 2004 was genaamd Kallocain. Men tekende kort hiervoor een contract bij het Inside Out label, die een live uitzending verzorgde vanuit de RockPalast in Köln. Deze beelden werden als deel van een speciale luxe editie van Kallocain op het album gezet. Het album werd gemixed door Steve Wilson van Porcupine Tree. <br>Silence of another Kind (afgekort als SOAK) werd door de band uitgebracht in 2006, gevolgd door een uitgebreide tour door Europa, om het album te promoten. PAATOS was zowel headliner als opener voor Porcupine Tree. <br>Terwijl men tourde nam de band gedeelten van de optredens op en bracht dit uit onder de naam Sensors. De opnames werden eerst in 2008 uitgebracht op vinyl op het Mellotronen label en later in dat jaar op cd in Japan op het Arcangelo label. <br>In 2009 begon met met het schrijven van hun vijfde album Breathing. Hier is ook de nieuwe bassist Rockis op te horen. Hun samenwerking met Inside Out eindigde en men tekende bij het Nederlandse label Glassville Records. Samen met het uitkomen van dit album, maakte PAATOS een video van het eerste nummer op het album, Gone genaamd. <br>A Liquid Landscape: <br>Aangespoeld, moe en zich voortslepend over een strand in de vroege ochtend uren. Ergens in het schemergebied van wanhoop en overgave, is er nog steeds een sprankje hoop. Het gevoel dat alles goed komt, maakt niet uit hoe de kansen staan. Dat is hoe A LIQUID LANDSCAPE zich aanhoort. <br>Hun debut album Nightingale Express gaat helemaal over de reis, zowel inwaarts als uitwaarts. Het gaat over het vinden van de plek waar je thuis hoort, het piekerende gevoel van onzekerheid en tenslotte zelfbedrog. Zoals iedere reis heeft ook deze zijn ups en downs, zijn hoogtepunten en dieptepunten. Maar Nightingale Express is meer dan zomaar een concept-album. De band wilde er helemaal voor gaan. Daarom huurde men filmproducent Lex Vesseur in, om iets te maken dat het album visueel zou begeleiden. Het resultaat is een kort film met prachtige beelden, deze zullen tijdens de live show te zien zijn, alsmede op de website. <br>The Sixxis: <br>De SIXXIS zijn eindelijk klaar ervoor om er helemaal voor te gaan en de wereld te veroveren. Men verzameld alle krachten en intensiteit om de mainstream te doen overstromen als de tijd er klaar voor is. Resonerend en donderend, hun muziekstijl hoort zich aan als een naderende storm. Kort nadat je ze voor het eerst hoort zul je worden doordrenkt, in volle kracht en de aanzwellende echo van het tumult. <br>Na jaren underground te hebben geleefd zijn de SIXXIS er klaar voor om grotere en betere dingen mee te maken. Sinds hun formatie in 2006 heeft de band te maken gehad met verschillende wisselingen in de bezetting, in hun stijl, maar dit jonge alternatieve rock trio, dat iedereen groet vanuit Atlanta (Georgia ) is trouw gebleven aan hun visie, hun avant-garde geluid cultiverend alsmede hun ontluikende publiek, zich niet laten afschrikken door tegenspoed en er klaar voor zijn om te groeien met de ervaringen die ze zullen opdoen, goed en slecht. En nu is het broederschaps gevoel van de band sterker dan ooit. <br>Het product van krachtige muzikale training en gepassioneerde toewijding voor hun diverse instrumenten. The SixxiS zijn een band met muzikanten.

"Paatos","Sixxis","The Rock Temple","Verleden jaar maakte de Zweedse art-rock band PAATOS een geweldige comeback met het adembenemende album Breathing. Dit jaar zullen ze eindelijk weer te zien zijn op de podia verspreid over heel Europa, samenvallend met wederom een nieuw album. <br>De band maakte hooge kwalitatieve albums in het verleden, waaronder Kallocain, gemixed door Steven Wilson. In de jaren 2004-2007 trad PAATOS vaak op en ging op tour met The Gathering en Porcupine Tree. <br>In Oktober zal het nieuwe album, dat nieuwe, maar ook oude nummers in een ander arrangement opgenomen bevat, uitkomen op het Nederlandse label Glassville Records. Er zijn verschillende vinyl release voor het najaar gepland, welke leiden tot de tour die in November zal starten. Ze worden begeleid door 2 veelbelovende bands. <br>A LIQUID LANDSCAPE (NL) brachten hun debut album Nightingal Express uit in het begin van dit jaar. Het is een concept album, dat regisseur Lex Vesseur ertoe inspireerde om een kort film te maken met muziek van dat album. Hij maakt ook het art-work en de visuele effecten voor de live show. Het album werd gemixed door Forrester Savell (Helmet, Karnivool). Beiden, het album en de live shows, krijgen uitstekende recensies. Deze gepassioneerde muziek in de trend van Karnivool, Anathema en Porcupine Tree. <br>THE SIXXIS zullen de avond beginnen met hun opwindende rock nummers. De band heeft zojuist een EP opgenomen die in de herfst zal uitkomen. Ze maken zich klaar om met de beroemde band VOLBEAT op pad te gaan in de VS. Resonant en donderend, hun muziek hoort zich aan als een storm die zich in de verte aankondigd. <br>Een korte historie. <br>PAATOS werd opgericht in het jaar 2000 en begon als rhythm sectie voor de Zweedse Folk Rock zanger Turid. Dit ontstak het vuurtje en al gauw kwam Petronella bij de band als zangeres en celliste. Orginele composities begonnen al snel vorm aan te nemen. <br>Timeloss was het eerste studio-album van de band en werd oorspronkelijk op het label van Stockholm Records uitgebracht in 2002 en op het Inside Out label als re-issue in 2005, samen met 2 bonus songs en een video. <br>Het album van PAATOS uit 2004 was genaamd Kallocain. Men tekende kort hiervoor een contract bij het Inside Out label, die een live uitzending verzorgde vanuit de RockPalast in Köln. Deze beelden werden als deel van een speciale luxe editie van Kallocain op het album gezet. Het album werd gemixed door Steve Wilson van Porcupine Tree. <br>Silence of another Kind (afgekort als SOAK) werd door de band uitgebracht in 2006, gevolgd door een uitgebreide tour door Europa, om het album te promoten. PAATOS was zowel headliner als opener voor Porcupine Tree. <br>Terwijl men tourde nam de band gedeelten van de optredens op en bracht dit uit onder de naam Sensors. De opnames werden eerst in 2008 uitgebracht op vinyl op het Mellotronen label en later in dat jaar op cd in Japan op het Arcangelo label. <br>In 2009 begon met met het schrijven van hun vijfde album Breathing. Hier is ook de nieuwe bassist Rockis op te horen. Hun samenwerking met Inside Out eindigde en men tekende bij het Nederlandse label Glassville Records. Samen met het uitkomen van dit album, maakte PAATOS een video van het eerste nummer op het album, Gone genaamd. <br>A Liquid Landscape: <br>Aangespoeld, moe en zich voortslepend over een strand in de vroege ochtend uren. Ergens in het schemergebied van wanhoop en overgave, is er nog steeds een sprankje hoop. Het gevoel dat alles goed komt, maakt niet uit hoe de kansen staan. Dat is hoe A LIQUID LANDSCAPE zich aanhoort. <br>Hun debut album Nightingale Express gaat helemaal over de reis, zowel inwaarts als uitwaarts. Het gaat over het vinden van de plek waar je thuis hoort, het piekerende gevoel van onzekerheid en tenslotte zelfbedrog. Zoals iedere reis heeft ook deze zijn ups en downs, zijn hoogtepunten en dieptepunten. Maar Nightingale Express is meer dan zomaar een concept-album. De band wilde er helemaal voor gaan. Daarom huurde men filmproducent Lex Vesseur in, om iets te maken dat het album visueel zou begeleiden. Het resultaat is een kort film met prachtige beelden, deze zullen tijdens de live show te zien zijn, alsmede op de website. <br>The Sixxis: <br>De SIXXIS zijn eindelijk klaar ervoor om er helemaal voor te gaan en de wereld te veroveren. Men verzameld alle krachten en intensiteit om de mainstream te doen overstromen als de tijd er klaar voor is. Resonerend en donderend, hun muziekstijl hoort zich aan als een naderende storm. Kort nadat je ze voor het eerst hoort zul je worden doordrenkt, in volle kracht en de aanzwellende echo van het tumult. <br>Na jaren underground te hebben geleefd zijn de SIXXIS er klaar voor om grotere en betere dingen mee te maken. Sinds hun formatie in 2006 heeft de band te maken gehad met verschillende wisselingen in de bezetting, in hun stijl, maar dit jonge alternatieve rock trio, dat iedereen groet vanuit Atlanta (Georgia ) is trouw gebleven aan hun visie, hun avant-garde geluid cultiverend alsmede hun ontluikende publiek, zich niet laten afschrikken door tegenspoed en er klaar voor zijn om te groeien met de ervaringen die ze zullen opdoen, goed en slecht. En nu is het broederschaps gevoel van de band sterker dan ooit. <br>Het product van krachtige muzikale training en gepassioneerde toewijding voor hun diverse instrumenten. The SixxiS zijn een band met muzikanten.

We would pile in a van, like every other punkband, and thunder off in pursuit of friends and glory in some basement in front of 20 people, 50 people, in towns 4-5 hours away. Sometimes there would be more than a hundred people and we would later in the week refer to that as a \"\"big show\"\". We were ambitious, but we didn't think of it as a career. We never made any fiscal sense whatsoever during 7 years of touring. Like most punkbands, it never occured to us to even try. We had a scene, we had some politics and we had just a hint of artistic ambition. True to our swedish roots we got very serious very fast. And then suddenly we got good. It's a delicate path to tread for precocious twentysomethings anywhere on the planet, but this particular bunch didn't make it. And that was fine. Most enterprises in life are unrelated to incredibly violent rock music. It's been a motley 14 years since our band came apart. We've all kept busy in our respective endeavors but we've all remained friends and kept in touch. There have been offers, and lots of jokes about these offers. We've sort of looked down from our high horses and made fun of people who've just wanted to share the psychopathic intensity that we would deliver on a nightly basis in our post-pubescent prime. A reunion has just seemed irrelevant to us. Too much other shit to do. But then Kristofer got his degree from the Swedish opera academy, Jons medical studies began drawing to a close and Dennis and David started a new hardcore band together. Finally, after a decade and a half hiatus, Kristofer picked up the guitar again. Which made David want to play the drums again. Which in turn led to all four of us suddenly making new music in assorted constellations. As all this was brewing, Coachella got in touch. There were a couple of phone-calls, lots of skepticism, some hesitant enthusiasm before one of us basically said: \"\"- This is ridiculous. There are friends of ours who would murder close relatives just to go see bands there. Let's just do it, one last time.\"\" And with that, socialist fag-loving pc scumbags were on the road again. We never did \"\"The shape of punk to come\"\" justice back when it came out, too tangled up in petty internal bickering to really focus on the job. And suddenly there's this possibility to do it like it was intended. We wanna do it over, do it right. For the people who've kept the music alive through the years, but also for our own sakes. We feel that you deserve it and we hope the feeling is mutual. See you in the pit. //Refused  "

Support comes from Darren Hayman, playing songs from his latest album The Ship's Piano on the venue's baby grand. <br>BUTCHER BOY <br>Beginning in its current form in 2005, Glaswegian seven-piece Butcher Boy released Profit in Your Poetry in 2007 to a flurry of press activity, including a First Sight Feature in The Guardian and a 4/5 review in Uncut. Second release React Or Die (2009) made even more of an impact, The Times' Peter Paphides intimating that the album was as important as any of those released by The Smiths or Belle and Sebastian in his 5/5 review. The album also received a 5/5 review from The Sunday Telegraph and scores of 9/10 from Drowned in Sound and 8/10 in the NME. The amount of critical acclaim garnered for their first two albums were surely heralding in a significant band for our time - but no-one was more shocked than the band themselves when React Or Die was voted one of The Times' top 100 albums of the 2000s. The band have recently released their third album Helping Hands through Damaged Goods and it turns out it's yet another momentous album, weaving rich storytelling and exquisite arrangements, allowing the strength of their songwriting to shine through. <br>\"\"Like those of Tindersticks and The Chameleons, Hunt's intelligent, unshowy songs are often so intimate you feel privileged simply to be listening to them.\"\" Metro <br> http://www.butcher-boy.co.uk <br>DARREN HAYMAN (SOLO PIANO SET) <br>Best known as the singer-songwriter of the phenomenally successful and much-loved Hefner, Darren Hayman is now six albums into an increasingly idiosyncratic career path writing the theme tune and staring in a Spanish sitcom, playing a 30 people capacity show in a 100 year old paper mache observatory and playing possibly Britiain's most remote festival on the Isle of Eigg. Darren is also writing the best tunes of his career increasingly complex and mature songs. Following his January Songs project Darren has continued one of his busiest years with a brand new solo album of subtle, drifting piano ballads called The Ship's Piano. <br>\"\"London's laureate of sexual dysfunction, discomfort, and dog-eared under-achievement... the match of Ray Davies, or any of the quintessentially English masters.\"\" (The Guardian) <br> http://www.hefnet.com£12.50 - 13 tickets available <br><a href=\"\"http://www.wegottickets.com/faqs/10\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">No reallocation</a> <br>All ages  <br><a href=\"\"https://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&username=xa-4c3707136e443a82\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> </a> "
"The Wonder Years","Polar Bear Club","Troubadour","Cost: adv tix $13.00/day of show tix $15.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Polar Bear Club, Transit, The Story So Far, Into It Over It  <br> The Wonder Years  <br> What was originally a one-off song written by a group of bored suburban kids turned into a five-year plan none of them were expecting. Call it the ultimate after-school project. With only the intent and purpose of taking that one song and infecting it on everyone they knew, this ragtag group of \"\"socially awkward\"\" musicians called The Wonder Years found themselves in the middle of a burgeoning - wait for it - career. Now, as the band joins the Hopeless Records family, it's obvious their easygoing short-term plans have changed dramatically. The Wonder Years have come a long way from piggybacking their friends' shows in Philly with that one initial song to sharing stages with the likes of New Found Glory, Set Your Goals and Comeback Kid. Oh, and Boyz II Men. Comprised of Dan \"\"Soupy\"\" Campbell (vocals), Casey Cavaliere and Matt Brasch (guitar), Nick Steinborn (keys/guitar), Josh Martin (bass) and Michael Kennedy (drums), they're a band that used to borrow gear from their friends, trying to make shows memorable and exciting without worrying whether it was a perfect set or if they were even on time. It shows what the relatable appeal of a band can do - even when, as in the early days, they're not even really trying. Their influences, ranging from tour mates NFG to Saves the Day and the Hold Steady, are apparent in the attitude of a band that just want to connect with their audience in the most authentic and unpretentious way possible. \"\"We're just ourselves all the time, and we don't have any rad gimmicks,\"\" Campbell said. \"\"We play loud and fast and recklessly. We front flip off speakers and sweat and spit and break just about everything. We've walked off stage needing stitches more than once.\"\" \"\"We're a band very much charge of ourselves. We always kind of know exactly what we want to do and exactly how we want to do it, and we like Hopeless because they let us do just that,\"\" Campbell said. The Wonder Years released their follow up to \"\"The Upsides\"\" this year. Their highly anticipated album \"\"Suburbia, I've Given You All And Now I'm Nothing\"\" is available now.  "
"The Black Keys","Arctic Monkeys","BOK Center"," Time : 8:00pm <br> Location : BOK Center, Tulsa <br> About the Show <br> The Black Keys new album, El Camino, released December 6 on Nonesuch Records, debuted at 2 on the Billboard Top 200. The duo is currently featured on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine for the first time (January 19 issue). In celebration of the release, embarks on the first leg of their North American tour this March, featuring sold-out shows at Chicagos United Center, DCs Verizon Center, and two nights at New Yorks Madison Square Garden followed by a second batch of April dates, including shows at Austins Frank Erwin Center and Tulsas BOK Center. Special guests Arctic Monkeys open on the tour. <br> In anticipation of the release, the duo recently joined Steve Buscemi on the December 2 episode of Saturday Night Live. This was the bands second time in 2011 as musical guests on the show, a rare distinction, says Rolling Stone. Other recent television appearances include The Colbert Report and the Late Show with David Letterman. Produced by Danger Mouse and The Black Keys, El Camino was recorded in the bands new hometown of Nashville during the spring of 2011. In advance of the release, the albums first single, Lonely Boy, was released in October, to acclaim from fans and press the song climbed the radio charts rapidly and is currently 1 on the AAA chart and has spent weeks at 1 on the Alternative chart. It also has entered the top 10 at Rock radio. Additionally, the accompanying video has been viewed nearly six million times on YouTube.  <br> Describing the sound of the album, drummer Patrick Carney tells Rolling Stone, Every record, we figure out the mood and stick with that. With Brothers, we were listening to a lot of hip-hop and old R&B and drawing from that. This is the first record weve made where its all rock & roll. And in an interview with Spin Magazine Auerbach says, Ive never been into guitar solos. I really like when every instrument in the band is a rhythm instrument. This record has a lot of that going on guitar, bass, drums, and keyboards all working together as a rhythm instrument. But unlike Brothers, which has more of these slower songs with an open feeling, the new LP is definitely fast. <br> El Camino follows the most successful two years in The Black Keys career. In May 2010 they released their breakthrough album, Brothers. It won three Grammy Awards and an MTV Video Music Award, and topped numerous year-end lists. Brothers, which included the hit singles Tighten Up and Howlin for You, has been certified Gold in the U.S. and U.K., and Platinum in Canada. U.S. sales are nearly one million and counting. <br> Showings <br> April 28, 2012 - 8:00PM <br> Event Information <br> Doors: 7:00pm <br> Tickets: $49.50, $42.50 <br> On Sale Time: January 13, 2012 - 10:00am "

"Japandroids","Bleached","Wonder Ballroom","Cost: $16.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Bleached  <br> Japandroids  <br> Japandroids is a two piece band from Vancouver, BC. This 'band' started in 2006 and consists of Brian King and David Prowse. Originally intending to be a trio, the boys decided to forego the logistical nightmare of having a 'lead singer' and do it themselves. As a consequence, Japandroids are one guitar, one set of drums, and two vocalizers. Japandroids are maximal – a two piece band trying to sound like it's a five piece band. Their 'songs' run the gauntlet of rock & roll subgenres, with the boys ripping off too many different bands to sound like any other duo making music right now. After self-releasing two EPs, 2007's All Lies and 2008's Lullaby Death Jams, Japandroids released their critically acclaimed debut album Post-Nothing via Polyvinyl in 2009. The boys toured extensively throughout 2009–2010, playing over 200 shows in more than 20 countries, and quickly gained notoriety for their extremely energetic live performances. Finding it difficult to write and record a second album in the midst of such a heavy touring schedule, Japandroids released a series of 7'' singles throughout 2010, each one recorded during a brief interval between tours. The same year, Japandroids re-released their first two EPs as a compilation titled No Singles, which included a booklet detailing their early history. 5 long years in 2 short paragraphs. Not bad. Perhaps the most pertinent detail omitted from said paragraphs is the fact that at no point during this time did Brian and David even discuss the possibility of writing, let alone recording, a second Japandroids album. With the band having more or less imploded late in 2008 (after what was considered to be a valiant but ultimately fruitless effort), one single regret still lingered, and despite their wounds and subsequent estrangement, continued effortlessly to slander them and their attempts to move on, like the subtle scent of skin on the sheets days after the desecration. Ipso facto, the sole motivation for revisiting the band many months later was simply to see if they could exploit their sudden newfound internet popularity and take Japandroids on the road. Due in part to the unexpected (and untimely) discovery of the band early in 2009 by certain online entities and their congregations, what previously seemed reserved for only the most ardent hearts, presented itself to Japandroids like a deal from the devil himself. Cautiously seduced, Brian and David decided in favour of their romantic notions of the open road, and set upon a crusade to swindle the soul of a continent. Tour was the fire to which they fed themselves. As days became weeks, so too did months become years. Finally, having exhausted themselves, as well as the immediate charm of Post-Nothing, and with only one final recording session looming on the horizon, the boys found themselves at a crossroads. Would they abandon their days on the wind and nights on the rocks in favour of the gentle lull of a geographic coma? No one knew not even the boys themselves. That is, until one cool New York night, when under the spell of the city's swill, they cast off the demons of doubt, having come in through the out door, back out through the window. For months, they laboured. Through the endless rains and windless chills of a northwestern winter, Japandroids fought tirelessly against their own creative limitations, struggling to expand their sound beyond the simple sloganeering that dominated Post-Nothing. Stuck knee deep in the swamp of summer, time had chased them down, and caught them waiting patiently. Had it not been for the fever of fall, with the boys back on tour where they belong, all might have been lost. Run out of town, they vowed not to return in anything less than triumph. Settling under the sulfurous skies of the south, Japandroids continued to labour through the dying months of 2011, returning reluctantly with nothing short of an album. As with countless previous recording sessions, the boys would bestow their faith solely upon Heaven's native son, Jesse Gander. An inexhaustible rocket of patience and dedication, Gander's unique ability to build cathedrals out of criminals was pushed to its absolute limit, as Brian and David demanded he coax only the purest nectar from their delinquent hearts. And so he did: \"\"Let's make this one a little more cruising down the highway, and a little less doing crystal meth on New Year's…\"\" \"\"That take was the perfect mixture of pee and poo – it had the fluidity of pee, and the solidness of poo…\"\" And so on and so forth, until not even the deepest and darkest of nights could extinguish what can only be described as living fireworks. Celebration Rock – a title in and of itself so controversial that at first utterance, it was so feared and hated that Polyvinyl felt compelled to plead for an alternative. But the band would not yield. Hell was just going to have to come and get them. So there you have it. 1 year, 8 songs, 35 mins. Not bad. As for everything else, I've got no answers. Any questions? Reference materials: 8 song albums – Raw Power by The Stooges, Born To Run by Bruce Springsteen, IV by Led Zeppelin 35 min albums – Let It Be by The Replacements, Revolver by The Beatles, Pet Sounds by The Beach Boys  "

"Converge","Torche","The Masquerade","Cost: $15 / $17.  <br> Wednesday November 7th <br>Heaven • 7:00 PM • $15.00 ADV <br>\"\"All We Love We Leave Behind\"\" <br> Converge <br> Torche, Kvelertak, Whips/Chains <br> It never ceases to amaze me how the things we initially dismiss, overlook, don't notice can become the most important and meaningful to us and our lives.The first time I saw Converge was in 1996 with Deadguy, Coalesce and a number of other bands whose names are now lost to memory in a Legion Hall in a rundown part of Buffalo, NY. I'd like to say they changed my life that night but they didn't - not that night, anyway. However, there was something about the way their rail-thin singer (Jacob Bannon) threw himself without regard into his performance, and the audience, and glimpses of the more than then-typical Victory Records mosh in their music that spoke of things to come. If you told me that band (Converge, I would discover later while buying Deadguy merch) would become one of the most important to not only myself but to aggressive music and its various scenes and factions, I would have cracked a smile, at the very least. Funny, how things turn out.Formed in the winter of 1990 in Boston, MA, during the rise and subsequent fall of the legendary Boston hardcore scene, Converge are unarguably one of the most important bands in the history of aggressive music. Through numerous line-up changes (the band are currently comprised of vocalist/visual design terrorist Jacob Bannon, drummer Ben Koller, guitarist/back-up vocalist Kurt Ballou and bassist/back-up vocalist Nate Newton), musical trends (mosh, tech, guys crying and wearing make-up, '80s thrash revival) and the coming and going of more \"\"the next great thing\"\" than I care to recall, Converge have established themselves as leaders in the aggressive music underground.It seems redundant to use the word \"\"landmark\"\" when discussing their musical canon, as almost every album is genre-defining, but Converge's run is unparalleled. Releases such as Petitioning the Empty Sky (1997), When Forever Comes Crashing (1998), Jane Doe (2001), You Fail Me (2004) and No Heroes (2006) have established Converge as trendsetters and innovators, setting new standards in hardcore and metal with each release. These records have evolved the band (from their thrash-inspired, hardcore-drenched beginnings to slower, more ominous and atmospheric work to all-out Tsunami-of-hostility hell-bent on levelling creation) and produced new waves of followers and emulators with each successive work. Honestly, has there been a band more influential on past and present \"\"successful\"\" metal/hardcore acts as unaccredited? It's true: integrity has its price.After nearly 20 years, such a glorious run of releases and a live show that's gone from flailing kids flailing against kids to legendary exorcism for both band and audience - watch the pit during \"\"The Saddest Day\"\" and tell me it's not the closest thing to a near-religious experience atheists will ever have - Converge could be forgiven for releasing an endeavour that was simply good, okay, just maintaining their status quo. After all, it's much easier to win the title than retain it, and even the greats slip from time to time. Axe To Fall (Converge's third release for indie institution Epitaph Records), however, is no such relapse.True to themselves and their art, as always, no matter the cost, Axe To Fall continues to push relentlessly forward, much like a shark that needs to always keep swimming to survive. Where No Heroes was a refinement and broadening of hostilities declared on previous assaults such as Jane Doe, Axe To Fall returns to the more AmRep-inspired noisecore abrasions of You Fail Me while also updating and making vital the thrash influences that defined earlier Converge efforts (Caring and Killing, Petitioning the Empty Sky) and retaining the hardcore hostilities and frantic pace so vital to their foundation. Of course, the experimental anguish and pleading for salvation are no mere sharpening of past knives but yet another leap forward in an existence full of them.From frenetic, frantic opening track \"\"Dark Horse,\"\" which is a downhill avalanche of ferocity culminating in one of the heaviest riffs Converge have ever laid listeners to waste with, to \"\"Worms Will Feed,\"\" an ominous exploration that ebbs and flows, building upon crashing then retreating waves of music and lyrical condemnations (\"\"the worms will find a way, the rats will find a way\"\"), to the barely restrained chaos of \"\"Losing Battle\"\" and Axe To Fall's sanguine, beautiful, climatic seven-minute-plus dénouement, \"\"Wretched Word,\"\" Axe To Fall isn't just another mere \"\"release\"\" or record from spoiled kids discovering metal and crying about how difficult life is in the suburbs. Axe To Fall is a nearly two-decade culmination of hard roads travelled and unwanted, but necessary, lessons learned, of prayers for salvation lost to the wind and too-fleeting nights where everything was still, if only for a moment, consumed by morning's inevitable advance, of crushing defeats and the realization that the war only ends when we do, and it's not one we can win, merely endure.Once again recorded by Converge's resident engineering genius Kurt Ballou, whose God City Recording Studios has become the Mecca for aggressive music's elite to congregate at for assistance realizing their sonic sermons (from Trap Them and Genghis Tron to Torche and Buried Inside), Axe To Fall is as sonically dense a tapestry and punishing a release as Converge have ever conceived, once again perfectly echoing musically Bannon's heart-ripped-out-of-chest-but-still-beating lyrics. It's the summation of experiences learned working on records such as No Heroes and You Fail Me, also recorded by Ballou at God City, and it surpasses them.But even while Converge and Axe To Fall stand alone - as Bannon is so fond of saying live: \"\"we're born into this world alone, and we die alone, so make your mark while you're here\"\" - they've never forgotten the core values of the hardcore scene they were raised in, and raised others on: community. Axe To Fall is Converge's most collaborative effort to date, even while paradoxically sounding as focused as ever. Axe To Fall features the likes of John Pettibone (Undertow, Himsa), Ulf Cederlund (Entombed, Disfear), Cave In's Steve Brodsky, Adam McGrath and J.R. Connors, F. Sean Martin (Hatebreed), George Hirsch (Blacklisted) and Genghis Tron's Mookie Singerman, Hamilton Jordan and Michael Sochynsky, amongst others, contributing to its dense sonic soundscapes. Even Steve Von Till (of legendary star destroyers Neurosis) graces the record on \"\"Cruel Bloom,\"\" an ignoring of musical confines that sounds akin to something Tom Waits and Mr. Bungle might concoct if trapped in a watering hole on the fringes of Purgatory right before the end-time hit.Something Bannon said to me years ago during our very first interview has stuck with me ever since: that hardcore needs to be about something more than bad poetry and Slayer riffs. And that search for and desire to be something more have defined Converge since their inception, and continue to propel them and their art ever-forward. Through sheer hard work, perseverance and an unwavering commitment to artistic integrity Converge have risen from humble beginnings to become that mercurial and so very rare \"\"something more.\"\" Axe To Fall continues their reign, long may it last. - by Chris Gramlich (Exclaim!

Through sheer hard work, perseverance and an unwavering commitment to artistic integrity Converge have risen from humble beginnings to become that mercurial and so very rare \"\"something more.\"\" Axe To Fall continues their reign, long may it last. - by Chris Gramlich (Exclaim!

"Murder Of Crows","The Murder Of Crows","Amsterdam Bar and Hall","Cost: $10.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Deceitful Lapwings  <br> Murder Of Crows  <br> The Murder of Crows is an atmospheric alternative band from Duluth, MN. The duo consists of guitarist / vocalist Alan Sparhawk (Low, Retribution Gospel Choir, & The Black Eyed Snakes) and violinist/vocalist Gaelynn Lea (Snöbarn). The Murder of Crows was formed when Sparhawk and Lea did a live soundtrack to a Lon Chaney film screening in October 2011. Although at first it seemed an unlikely pairing – with Alan’s long history in the indie rock world and Gaelynn’s classical/folk background – their divergent musical styles created a complementary sound which was really quite lovely. What’s more, it turns out they enjoyed playing together, so the Murder was born. At its core, The Murder of Crows is built around slow, winding, hypnotic instrumentals that hopefully create a kind of mental journey. Sparhawk utilizes looping pedals and other musical gadgets to produce layered waves of sound. Their music has been described as meditative, haunting, intense, and beautifully sorrowful. The band prefers to think of it as ideal bird-watching music. On June 1st, 2012, The Murder of Crows released its first-ever recording, a 7-track EP Imperfecta. It consists of two of Gaelynn Lea's original songs and five instrumentals. They recorded it by the big picture window in Lea’s living room (where they always rehearse), inspired by the menagerie of neighborhood birds outside. The EP name, Imperfecta, has two meanings. It alludes to Lea's disability, Osteogenesis Imperfecta (which means Brittle Bones). Although Gaelynn's music is not intended to be \"\"about\"\" disability, it has still shaped her life in undeniable ways. Imperfecta also acknowledges the fact that, indeed, no one is perfect. Really we're all just trying to make something beautiful out of our lives, despite our flaws and our often less-than-ideal circumstances. Live sets by The Murder of Crows have evolved into a unique blend of instrumentals and vocal songs. They have added in a number of Gaelynn Lea’s originals, some choice covers (from bands like Neutral Milk Hotel, Peter Tosh, Nirvana, and of course, Low), and a wider, more dynamic range of instrumental pieces. Their banter between songs is of note: reticent, deadpan stoicism meets chatty, bubbly enthusiasm. It’s an odd combination that provides a breath between their sobering and often emotional pieces. Maybe it’s the contrast that’s refreshing. Or perhaps it’s because the duo’s endearing friendship shines through their idiosyncratic dialogue. Nevertheless, somehow it works.  "

"DRI","D.R.I.","Chain Reaction","Cost: $14.00 - $16.00.  <br> DRI  <br> We are a punk/metal crossover band with our roots set in Hardcore. Established way back in 1982 and now together for over 23 years, we have about 10 CDs & 2 DVDs out on various labels and are considered to be one of the forefathers of speed metal and thrash punk music. We started out in Texas and moved to the Bay Area cause we heard the SF area had free food at the soup kitchens (from which the classic tune was written!) When we started our influences were bands like Black Flag and the Dead Kennedys. In 1982 our first release, which was really a demo, kick started our career as a fomidable hardcore band. 22 songs in 17 minutes. Blistering fast, with on the dime cuts, and vocals to match. Said to contain the first grindcore blast ever recorded, this record was later pressed into an LP, and was considered to be our first official release even though it was only 17 minutes. The 22 song debut eventually was combined with our second release, 1984's Violent Pacification ep, and came out on CD in the mid eighties, when that technology reached indie lables. In 1985 we started to listen to bands like Metallica & Slayer. Our second full length release Dealing With It showed a progression to the metal side of the genre. This album also was said to make an impact, and helped start the crossover movement. DRI went on mixing its own brand of punk metal releasing Crossover, Four of a Kind, Thrash Zone, Definition, and a live album recorded in 1992, before releasing Full Speed Ahead in 1996. The band currently consists of original core members and song writing team, Spike Cassidy and Kurt Brecht. Along with now longtime members Rob Rampy and Harald O. Rob first appears on the 1992 Definition Release. Harald is known for his photographs of Metallica & Slayer way back in the day. We are that band with the skanker in the circle. You know, the running man. The mosher. The one thats on your parents old t-shirts. We apeared on a Beavis & Butthead episode. We also held the Guiness Book record for fastest band in the world, back in the day. We played with just about every major band you can name, and most festivals in our travels around the world for over two deacdes. We now have over 120 DRI songs under our belt, and still play about 35 or so when we play live. D.R.I. still tours all over the world and have been working on new material. We have had trouble writing new stuff cos we are all spread out across the U.S. and that makes it kinda hard to practice.  "

The original Urge lineup debuted in 1989 with the cassette-only Bust Me Dat Forty, followed a year later by the LP Puttin' the Backbone Back. After the additions of saxophonist Bill Reiter and trombonists Matt Kwiatkowski and Todd Painter, the group released 1992's Magically Delicious guitarist Jerry Jost and drummer John Pessoni joined a year later, and this lineup recorded the 1993 live LP Fat Babies in the Mix. A tour with 311 helped the Urge win any number of new fans, and 1995's Receiving the Gift of Flavor was so successful that it brought the band to the attention of Epic's Immortal imprint, which reissued the LP in 1996. Master of Styles followed in 1998. Too Much Stereo came in mid-2000. ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide "

"Anamanaguchi","Fang Island","Local 506","Cost: $10.00 - $12.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Fang Island, Moon King  <br> Anamanaguchi  <br> Anamanaguchi is a four-piece melodic, 8-bit rock band from Brooklyn, New York. Combining raw guitars and thrashing drums with a glitchy digital soundscape, they create a powerful, energetic sound that rests somewhere between organic and robotic. The band, started in 2003 by then 15-year-old Peter Berkman, released their debut POWER SUPPLY EP on the New York DIY label 8bitpeoples in 2006. In 2009 the lineup solidified with bassist James DeVito, Ary Warnaar on guitar & gameboy, and Luke Silas on drums and they released their second EP, DAWN METROPOLIS. Anamanaguchi embodies the triumph over youthful suburban boredom through house shows, pizza parties, and late night video game sessions with friends in the same way the Beach Boys did through cars, babes, and surfing.

"The Twilight Sad","Errors","The Space","Cost: $12.00 - $15.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Errors, Landing  <br> The Twilight Sad  <br> Based outside of Glasgow, The Twilight Sad formed in late 2003. The band played a couple of gigs at the 13th Note in Glasgow, creating half hour-long pieces of music using guitars, bass, drums, theremin, tape loops from films and old folk/country songs, effects pedals, toy keyboards, thumb pianos, saws, computer games and a lot of noise in an attempt to try and discover a sound they could call their own and continue to develop. After these two shows, they rejected many gig offers, and became a more reclusive unit, spending any spare time they had in the studio focused on writing and sculpting away at new material. In September 2005, they wrote four songs they thought gave a relatively good perspective of the band, and went into a local studio to record them, producing it themselves. Staying in the studio for many nights, they used a 24-track desk to build layer upon layer of sound, trying to get the best representation as possible. Thinking that the CD they came out with showed little more than some kind of raw potential, they posted it down to FatCat as a demo. After receiving a positive response and a request for more tracks, the band continued to expand on their song writing and kept regularly in contact with the label. Instead of paying for more studio time they began to make lo-fi recordings in bedrooms, bathrooms and their own rehearsal space, developing a more folk/experimental/noise sound. In mid-May the band came down to Brighton to meet the label and played on the bill of a FatCat night on the pier alongside The Mutts, Charlottefield, The Rank Deluxe, and fellow Glasgow band, The Frightened Rabbit. Where the band's recorded sound is layered with many melodies, their live sound is a more intense experience which replaces the intricacies of the recordings with a more visceral wall of noise.  "

"High On Fire","Goatwhore","White Rabbit Pizzeria","Cost: $15.00 - $17.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Goatwhore, Lo-Pan  <br> High On Fire  <br> It was the late, great novelist and caffeine enthusiast Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850) who said, \"\"Power is not revealed by striking hard or often, but by striking true.\"\" And yet High On Fire have managed to do all three. Since the Oakland power trio's inception in 1998 they've released six earth-splitting albums, each seemingly more unstoppable than the last. Forever haunting the halls of the Iommic Temple—the band's own philosophical monument to Black Sabbath riff master Tony Iommi—High On Fire have become legends in their own time. As bong-huffing genre music rises and falls around them like so much windborne detritus, guitarist/vocalist Matt Pike, drummer Des Kensel and bassist Jeff Matz comprise the all-seeing eye of a perpetual riff-storm, always looking toward a future in which The End is always near. After unleashing one of the most momentous debuts in the history of heavy music with 2000's The Art Of Self-Defense, High On Fire doubled down in 2002 with the absolutely punishing Surrounded By Thieves, an album that even notoriously finicky music website Pitchfork rated an 8.8 out of 10. \"\"Surrounded By Thieves pushes drones to its limits, with a crushing wall of bass tones guaranteed to alter heart rhythms and weaken building infrastructures,\"\" they gushed, before adding the obvious disclaimer: \"\"If you've never experienced street drugs, it's a safe bet you probably won't enjoy this album.\"\" And the hits just kept on coming: High On Fire's 2005 album, Blessed Black Wings, was named one of the top 50 albums of the 21st century by prominent UK music weekly Kerrang! In 2007, the band's Death Is This Communion ranked # 3 on Revolver magazine's year-end list, while landing the # 4 spot in Total Guitar. That same year, Matt Pike was named one of rock's \"\"New Guitar Gods\"\" by Rolling Stone. Fast forward to 2012 and High On Fire's new album, De Vermis Mysteriis. Produced by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou at God City Studios in Salem, MA, the record marks the next devastating chapter in High On Fire's gloriously unhinged metal saga. \"\"It's a fuckin' awesome album,\"\" Pike enthuses. \"\"I think it's kind of a cross between the experimentation of Death Is This Communion and the driving darkness of Blessed Black Wings. There's plenty of thrashy stuff, but there's also a lot of Sabbathy doom-type stuff.\"\" \"\"We didn't try to plan it all out this time,\"\" he adds. \"\"We kind of waited 'til we were on the spot and had to do something. We had the basic skeletons of the songs—we were prepared—but there was a lot of improvisation. There's a lot of soul on this one, and it's got a rollercoaster kind of feel.\"\" The album's title (translation: \"\"The Mysteries of the Worm,\"\") is a nod to a fictional grimoire conceived by the late, great Psycho author Robert Bloch in 1935 and later incorporated into horror master H.P. Lovecraft's renowned Cthulu Mythos. \"\"It's a concept record, a little bit,\"\" Pike offers. \"\"I got this idea about Jesus Christ and the Immaculate Conception: What if Jesus had a twin who died at birth to give Jesus his life? And then what if the twin became a time traveler right then? He lives his life only going forward until he finds this scroll from an ancient Chinese alchemist who derived a serum out of the black lotus—which is actually in Robert E. Howard's 'Conan' stories—and then he starts traveling back in time. He can see the past through his ancestors' eyes, but his enemies can kill him if they kill the ancestor that he's seeing through at the time. Basically, he keeps waking up in other people's bodies at bad times. It's kinda like that old TV show Quantum Leap. Kurt actually pointed that out to me after I told him the idea. But whatever—time travel is a killer concept.\"\" \"\"Most people won't even get it, so I'm explaining it now—once,\"\" he concludes. \"\"After this, I'm done telling the story to people. So please make sure this gets printed.\"\"  "

"KRS One","KRS-ONE","Catalyst Club","Cost: $20 in advance / $25 at the door.  <br> KRS One  <br> KRS-One (born Kris Parker) was the leader of Boogie Down Productions, one of the most influential hardcore hip-hop outfits of the '80s. At the height of his career, roughly 1987-1990, KRS-One was known for his furiously political and socially conscious raps, which is the source of his nickname, \"\"the Teacher.\"\" Around the time of 1990's Edutainment, BDP's audience began to slip as many fans thought his raps were becoming preachy. As a reaction, KRS-One began to re-establish his street credibility with harder, sparer beats and raps. 1992's Sex and Violence was the first sign that he was taking a harder approach, one that wasn't nearly as concerned with teaching. KRS-One's first solo album, 1993's Return of the Boom Bap, was an extension of the more direct approach of Sex and Violence, yet it didn't halt his commercial decline. Still, he forged on with a high-quality self-titled 1995 effort and 1996's Battle for Rap Supremacy, a joint effort with his old rival, MC Shan. After 1997's I Got Next, he put his solo career on hiatus for several years, finally returning in early 2001 with The Sneak Attack. The following year brought two full releases: the gospel effort Spiritual Minded and The Mix Tape, the latter including a single (\"\"Ova Here\"\") that stood as a response to Nelly, only the latest hip-hop figure to feud with the Blastmaster. In 2003 KRS-One released two albums, Kristyles and D.I.G.I.T.A.L., while the next year brought only one, Keep Right. In 2006 Life came out on the small, California-based Antagonist Records. The following year KRS-One reunited with Marley Marl to create Hip Hop Lives, a lackluster attempt to preserve the golden age of hip-hop.  "

"The Revivalists","Van Ghost","Brooklyn Bowl","Cost: $7.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Van Ghost, Angela Perley & The Howlin' Moons  <br> The Revivalists  <br> What began as a chance encounter has become the next breakout band from the music capital of New Orleans. Neither lead singer David Shaw nor guitarist Zack Feinberg realized that life was going to be different when they randomly met in 2007. Two weeks after moving to New Orleans from Ohio, David Shaw was on his Birch Street porch with an acoustic guitar, strumming an original song called \"\"Purple Heart.\"\" A passing bicyclist stopped to listen. He turned out to be Zack Feinberg, a guitarist in search of a band. Shaw and Feinberg struck up a conversation, a friendship and, eventually, The Revivalists. Four years later, the Revivalists look and sound like a band on the brink. In 2011 they were named Best Emerging Artist at Gambit Magazine's Big Easy Awards, which in 2012 has nominated them as Best Rock Band. The Revivalists have been touring since 2008 and thriving on the national level, clocking in over 400 shows while sharing the stage and the road with such notable acts like Galactic, Trombone Shorty, The Rebirth Brass Band, The Radiators, JJ Grey & Mofro, and Alabama Shakes. Additionally, they have established themselves as an engaging festival act, winning over audiences at Voodoo Fest in New Orleans, DeLuna Fest in Florida, B.O.M.B Fest in Connecticut, The Kennedy Center Millennium Stage series in Washington, DC and the legendary New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival. There, they caught the attention of Rolling Stone Senior Editor David Fricke, who wrote about their performance on rollingstone.com. The Revivalists' 2008 self-titled debut E.P was an Editor's Pick for both the Jam Band and American Traditional Rock on CDBaby.com. The young band was privileged to record under the guidance of Grammy Award-winning engineer/producer Chris Finney, whose resumé ranges from Dr. John to R.E.M. Songs off the album have been featured on MTV, Paste Magazine's Music Sampler, and on American Airlines flights. Their first full-length Vital Signs quickly became the top-selling album on CDBaby in the American Rock category. The band's next album, City of Sound, released in March 2012, was produced by Ben Ellman, whose credits include Galactic, Gypsyphonic Dysko, and Trombone Shorty.  "

Each of your albums has been stronger than your last. You've been brought onstage by Bruce Springsteen, because he wanted to play one of your songs. You've seen high times and low ones, good days and tragic days, but every night you give 100%, and every morning you wake up still swinging. <br>This is the short version of the Social Distortion bio — the long version could be a 10-part mini-series. But over the past 30 years, the punk godfathers in the band have all but trademarked their sound, a brand of hard rockabilly/punk that's cut with the melodic, road-tested lyrics of frontman Mike Ness. Their searing guitars and a locomotive rhythm section sound as alive today as they did in '82, as do Ness' hard-luck tales of love, loss and lessons learned. \"\"The most common thing I hear is, 'Man, your music got me through some hard times,'\"\" Ness says. \"\"And I just say, 'Me too.'\"\" <br>Hard Times And Nursery Rhymes (produced, for the first time, by Ness himself) is the band's first record since 2004, but the break hasn't changed them much. It maintains Social Distortion's key components — an all-but-perfected mix of punk, bluesy rock n’ roll and outlaw country — but it also finds them stretching the boundaries of their signature sound. \"\"I didn't want any one style of writing,\"\" Ness says. \"\"I didn't want it to be all heavy, like \"\"White Light, White Heat, White Trash.\"\" I wanted some heavy and some light. I wanted some fiction and some nonfiction. I wanted versatility.\"\" <br>That's evident right away. The record's first vocal track, \"\"California (Hustle and Flow),\"\" finds Ness and the band not roaring out of the gate so much as swaggering behind a chunky Stones-style locomotive groove. \"\"This record has a lot of my influences,\"\" Ness says, \"\"But how far you go with those influences is up to you. With this record I wanted to go a little farther. I wanted people to hear that second track and realize, 'Wow, this is not just another Social Distortion record.'\"\" (For good measure the track has hints of \"\"Ball and Chain\"\" and the Stones' \"\"All Down The Line\"\" and, for the first time, female backing vocals. \"\"I've been listening to records for years with (backing vocals), and I was like, \"\"Hey, why don't I do that?\"\" Ness laughs.) <br>Not that the band's punk foundations have eroded the first single \"\"Machine Gun Blues,\"\" a piece of gangland fiction set in 1934, could hail from \"\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell.\"\" But the record is evidence of the band's ability to evolve. \"\"Bakersfield,\"\" a setlist staple in recent years, is a waking-on-the-railroad-tracks story of wrecked love, forgiveness and Buck Owens it closes with a spoken-word verse to make Merle Haggard smile. \"\"Can't Take It With You\"\" sports a Jerry Lee-style piano solo that scorches paint. And set closer \"\"Still Alive\"\" is a soaring carpe diem with an added emotional weight that can't be described or duplicated. <br>\"\"The album is reminiscent to me of \"\"Somewhere,\"\" but it also has some of the darkness that \"\"White Light\"\" had. It has some of the flavor of \"\"Mommy's Little Monster,\"\" Ness said. \"\"I think it's very signature. We've never been afraid to evolve and show people what we can do.\"\" <br>Now in their fourth decade, Ness and Social Distortion have officially done one of the most non-punk things possible: They've failed to burn out. <br>Mixing Springsteen’s factory-overalls ethic with Southern California punk energy and black leather, Social Distortion formed with Ness and high school buddy, the late Dennis Danell, in the late 1970s the group broke in 1983 with the thrashing plate of punk and displeasure \"\"Mommy's Little Monster.\"\" Their 1988 follow-up, \"\"Prison Bound,\"\" hinted at a sonic change to come, and by the band's self-titled 1990 record and 1992's \"\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell,\"\" their sound had solidified into the instantly recognizable brand of rock n’ roll that's defined them since. <br>For Hard Times, Social Distortion consists of Ness and longtime guitarist Jonny Wickersham, along with bassist Brent Harding and drummer David Hidalgo, Jr. <br>These days the band is rarely off the road for long, and continues to grip fans who have been around since \"\"Mommy's Little Monster\"\" while drawing new ones who discover the band through hand-shot YouTube clips. \"\"I see people bringing their kids to shows,\"\" Ness says. \"\"And I see kids bringing their parents.\"\" <br>Social Distortion is a mix of potent power, appeal across all age brackets and a genuine satisfaction at reaching as many people as they have. \"\"I write songs for myself, and I hope that other people will like them too,\"\" Ness says. \"\"I think every record you make is showing people what you've learned over the past few years. It's showing people, 'This is what I know.'\"\" "

"Minus The Bear","Girl In A Coma","Fremont Country Club","Cost: $23.00 - $26.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Cursive, Girl in a Coma  <br> Minus The Bear  <br> Taken from their website Minus the Bear have always avoided easy classification, preferring to tread their own inimitable path defined by energy and invention. OMNI, the Seattle-based band's fourth full-length recording and debut Dangerbird Records release, sees a stunning evolution to their sound and vision. As evinced by the album's all-encompassing title, Minus the Bear have merged their myriad influences into a sweeping collection marked by its slinky and sensual melding of city-stomping rock and deep funk grooves. That spirit of sonic lasciviousness is mirrored in the album's raw take on human sexuality – a theme as intricate and elaborate as the band's extraordinary music. Boldly experimental yet instantly accessible, OMNI is Minus the Bear's most provocative and potent work to date. \"\"I think it's a real leap forward,\"\" singer/guitarist Jake Snider agrees. \"\"It's an impactful sounding record.\"\" Founded in 2001, Minus the Bear earned immediate attention with their distinctive spastic prog-pop hybrid, all serrated rhythms, swirling synths, and guitarist Dave Knudson's multi-layered, pedal-hopping acrobatics. Prolific from the start, the band let loose with series of EPs and albums, each drawing escalating acclaim and a host of new fans. 2007's Planet of Ice was followed by the band's most intensive touring thus far, repeatedly traveling the US, as well as Europe, Australia, and Japan. The non-stop roadwork served to increase the band's kinetic power and intensity – a mindset they were determined to bring with them when they returned to the studio. \"\"One of the things we wanted to do was capture more of the live energy,\"\" says Knudson. \"\"We feel like the live show is really where you get to see what we're doing.\"\" Work officially began on the new album in mid-2008 as the band reconvened to begin shaping and developing Knudson's early demo tracks. This time out MTB wanted to collaborate with an outside producer and began interviewing potential candidates. Joe Chiccarelli (My Morning Jacket, The White Stripes, The Shins) flew up to Seattle for his meeting mere hours after accepting a Grammy Award for his work with The Raconteurs and the rapport was immediate, with producer and band in agreement about how to proceed. \"\"We played the songs for Joe in our rehearsal space and he had a ton of ideas,\"\" Snider says. \"\"He had a great sense of where things could be trimmed, so he was a good set of ears to help us edit what we were trying to get across.\"\" On April 27, 2009, Minus the Bear began sessions at Seattle's Avast! Recording Studios, opting to take a more organic approach towards recording. A conscious effort was made to play together as much as possible, eschewing the usual scratch tracks and overdubs whenever possible. \"\"He was really awesome about wanting to find the perfect sound before we even started tracking the songs,\"\" Knudson says. \"\"That was a big thing for us, changing the way we record, trying to keep as much of the performances that we were doing in the studio together to maintain the energy.\"\" \"\"Joe kicked a lot of us in the ass more than any of us had ever been kicked in the ass before,\"\" Knudson says. \"\"We were doing 10 or 12 takes, more than any of us had ever played, but obviously all those takes paid off. He broke us down and made us evaluate what we were doing and maybe made us think of it from a different perspective.\"\" Where Planet of Ice was deeply informed by the band's unified passion for classic prog-rock, OMNI sees each member bringing a diverse tableau of individual influences to the table, with keyboardist Alex Rose, bassist Cory Murchy, and drummer Erin Tate expressing a significant interest in jazz, hip-hop, R&B, and 70s funkadelia. \"\"Those underlying elements seeped through,\"\" Knudson says, \"\"whether or not we were cognicent of the fact that was happening. There's a lot more groove, a lot more soul, a lot more feeling that comes across.\"\" The new music's pulsating energy inspired a kind of sensual sprawl and carnal abandon. \"\"Secret Country\"\" features MTB's most propulsive riff to date, inspired by Knudson's purchase of a baritone guitar while on tour, while \"\"My Time\"\" – the album's first single – is a rush of pure electro-pop lust, built around the glorious sound of another of the guitarist's new toys, a vintage Omnichord synthesizer. \"\"The music just lent itself to dealing with these erotic themes,\"\" Snider says. \"\"There wasn't a conscious idea to keep it all that way, but I didn't really fight anything that came up when I was trying to put something to the music.\"\" None of which is to say that the quirky time signatures, hyperactive riffs, and prodigious hooks have left the building. The eddying tri-climax solo of \"\"The Thief\"\" and the album-closing \"\"Fooled By The Night,\"\" with its flowing arc and song-with a-song structure, reveal that MTB's trademarks have simply been morphed and molded to fit a more straightforward – though no less ingenious – songcraft. \"\"We always wanted to see just how weird we can make a pop song,\"\" Snider says, \"\"but I think at some point we abandoned that and just started wanting to write really good songs.\"\" With OMNI finished by summer's end, the band's next step was choosing the right label to put it out. Fortunately, the band ultimately united with the Silverlake-based independent label, Dangerbird Records. \"\"We really care about this and whoever was putting out the record had to be a cool, awesome, artist-friendly, happening place to be,\"\" Knudson says. \"\"Once we met up with [Dangerbird co-founder] Jeff Castelaz and those guys, it was just kinda like, 'Why would we pick someone else? This is exactly what we've been looking for.'\"\" The brazen and irresistible OMNI will undoubtedly bring Minus the Bear to scores of new listeners, keeping them on tour for the foreseeable future. The band are now ready to return to the road, knowing that their ever-increasing fan following awaits. Having built its base in no small part due to their exhilarating live shows, MTB have an advanced appreciation for the intimate connection between band and their audience. \"\"We've got a lot of fans that really care about us,\"\" Knudson says, \"\"that just love the music and keep coming out to show after show after show. I think about it every day, I think about how fuckin' lucky we are.\"\" \"\"The main thing we try to accomplish is putting together something that we're going to enjoy playing forever,\"\" Snider says. \"\"We always make sure that we want to hear the song as much as anybody else.\"\"  "

"PATRICK WATSON","Half Moon Run","The Crocodile",":: <a href=\"\"http://thecrocodile.com/events/5510320/patrick-watson#\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">PATRICK WATSON</a> ::  <br>Adventures In Your Own Backyard is a record made at home with lots of love. After our past tours and last recordings around the world, we decided to bring this album home. We set up our instruments in my loft and over a year, came in and out, just pressed “record” and hoped for the best. We recorded most of the music live, “off the floor”, trying to capture what people like about our shows, which can be difficult to transcribe in a studio sometimes. We also realized that when you’re making a record, it’s sometimes easier to make one that’s fun to work on but not necessarily one you would listen to. We noticed that records we love to listen to are more simple than the ones we’ve made, so we tried are best to make an album that was as easy and fun to do than it is to listen to. We decided to make a simple and grounded record where each single sound has to be a necessity, or cut. The adventure aspect consisted into bringing a little sugar to people’s home, inspired by Ennio Morricone’s soundtracks. <br>After being far from home, constantly inspired by exotic new places, the novelty begins slowly to wear off and the idea of “home” becomes inspiring and fun. Sometimes you take for granted all the amazing stories and people you walk by each day and start fantasizing about a faraway place, but you might miss the greatness that’s just right around you. This record has been a great companion to me while I was making it. I hope it treats everyone who listens the same way and I also hope it brings a little adventure into the listeners’ ears. <br>In terms of lyrics, I definitely tried my best to keep my ears open and to be inspired by the people around me. For example, the lyrics of the song “Strange Crooked Road” are based on a friend of mine family’s stories and if you try a little hard, you might be able to imagine these strange stories and people on your own / by yourself. “The Quiet Crowd” has been inspired by events like when you’re in an elevator packed with people, and there’s this uncomfortable silence and you can suddenly hear everyone’s thoughts. Secret thoughts that deep down in their heart, they would love to sing out loud. “Into Giants” is a simple song about a family growing together, getting better at facing things in unison and also about friendships, new friends as well as the ones you lost along the way. One of the most memorable stories that we brought home happened while we were driving to the Grand Canyon. On our way there, we met a guy who pulled his jeep in front of us pretty aggressively and gave us a 20 minute long sermon. He basically told us that we should talk to our instruments while playing our music and he did it with so much grace that it felt like it was a scene from a Cohen brother’s movie. Anyways, since then I can’t get that guy out of my head.” <br><a href=\"\"http://thecrocodile.com/events/5510320/patrick-watson#\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">HALF MOON RUN</a> "

"The Secret Post","Kill the Reflection","The Vanguard","Cost: $5.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Kill the Reflection, Young Lyons  <br> The Secret Post  <br> The Secret Post is the brainchild of Zachariah Wiser. The Post came into existence in early 2004, as an outlet for Zachariah's post-punk/New Wave influences to flourish. The Post started out as Zachariah himself, all alone, recording home demo's, as he was busy with WiseMan at the time. Zachariah moved back to Tulsa, his hometown, in the summer of 2006. He quickly began the hunt for members to make this project come to life. The Secret Post made a huge impact on the Tulsa scene a few short months later with a string of shows unlike that of which Tulsa hadn't seen in years. With Post-Punk long gone, this band decided to bring it back with the passion and stature of a brand new genre. The band is led by Zachariah's brooding vocals, and metaphorical lyrics about sex, death, despair, and love...with his melancholic and sometimes Staccato jerky rhythm guitar leading the way. He is backed by Nicoli on the drums, pounding like a ton of sullen bricks, with driving and steady flow, along with M on Bass, reminiscent of Peter Hook/Simon Gallup's attack/lead style of playing. Then we have Aleks on lead guitar, surrounded by mystery, you never know just exactly how far he will go off the deep end of emotion. Finally with Timothy DeCasper on synth, he provides the thick, stringed backdrop for Zachariah's songs in the fashion of a wall of sound. We, The Secret Post are stronger than ever, and have started our attack on the scene once again, not to retreat, but to strike at the core of your heart and soul, and make our presence known. With influences such as The Cure, Bauhaus, The Chameleons UK, Interpol, The Sound, Depeche Mode, Joy Division, and The Cult brimming in our music, how can we go wrong? The upcoming EP entitled \"\"Fields of Fire\"\" will be out November 17th, 2012. So stay tuned, and be watching for us, we are coming to a city near you soon...this is OUR winter, OUR year.  "

"Matt Wertz","STEVE MOAKLER","Rams Head on Stage","Cost: $20.  <br> Supporting Acts: Steve Moakler  <br> Matt Wertz  <br> Matt Wertz is excused. Yes, it has been three years since his last full-length release, but when you take his relentless touring schedule, a breakup with his major label, a new deal with Nettwerk and the trials and tribulations of life into account, the ever-so-charming singer-songwriter gets a pass. In fact, it's these experiences that have helped shaped the inspired songs on Wertz's new album, WEIGHTS & WINGS, and by that rationale, it was worth every bit of the wait. The Missouri native's fourth album was named before any of its songs were written, and the concept of Weights & Wings not only acted as a compass for the project, but also helped guide Wertz personally, as well. \"\"I got the title from a daily meditation book that I read,\"\" he explains. \"\"It's the idea that the heavy things in life and the transcendent times are both equally important in propelling us on and through life. There have been a lot of hard days in the past couple of years, and it's reassuring to know that they'll be put to use, that they're imperative to my life, and that I need them to balance out the other end.\"\" All of the songs on Wertz's new album are tied to relationships, and each track delves into what the singer has learned about himself and others during that last few years. More than ever, the reflective songwriter has his heart on his sleeve, and Weights & Wings is the very incarnation of that lifeline. The album's theme is best represented in \"\"Everything Will Be Alright,\"\" which was written by Wertz and his friend Ben Rector in the euphoria of a beautiful spring day. Wertz says the song is about getting lost over-thinking things, but by moving past what might be, situations end up working themselves out. \"\"There's a great Mark Twain quote, which says, 'I am an old man and have known a great many troubles but most of them never happened.'\"\" he says. \"\"If there were a subtitle or some kind of tag to the song, that would sum it up.\"\" \"\"Family\"\" began as a song for his sister who was going through a difficult time, but through the course of the writing cycle, Wertz realized he couldn't fix everything. \"\"I guess the irony in me writing that song for my sister was that it ended up being for me,\"\" he reveals. \"\"More times than not, songs do that. You think they're about one thing and they turn out to be about something else.\"\" \"\"Running Back to You\"\" is perhaps the album's most stunning track, featuring a grand chorus that grabs hold of heartstrings and never lets go. Despite what has happened in the relationship, Wertz sings about returning to the person who grounds him. The song was co-written by Rector and features background vocals by Dave Barnes. Of course, Weights & Wings wouldn't be complete without a classic love song. \"\"Feels So Right\"\" is an up-tempo track on which Wertz sings about the anticipation and excitement of telling a woman he loves her for the very first time. It is yet another example of Wertz's simple, yet acute songwriting ability. This year, Wertz will head back on the road to reconnect with his fans and share the songs he's worked so hard on. His hope is that listeners will be able to identify with his music, and find a \"\"windows down, sing along at the top of your lungs\"\" quality about the album, too. \"\"It's like I made a gift for someone,\"\" he muses. \"\"I created this scrapbook for someone, and I've saved all these memories and things I've put together. I'm going to give it to them for their birthday…I'm excited, but the real joy is seeing them open that gift.\"\"  "
"The Sword","Eagle Claw","The Beacham","Cost: $15.00 - $17.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Eagle Claw, Gypsyhawk  <br> The Sword  <br> \"\"Before forging the blade, the swordsmiths underwent fasting and ritual purification. They then worked at their anvils in white clothes, like the robes of the priests. Their efforts were well rewarded.\"\" One of the foundations of the metal revival of the past ten years, Austin TX's The Sword have released two flawless slabs of vintage heaviness on Kemado Records, toured the world with Metallica, and were one of the first bands to lock into a whole new legion of fans through Guitar Hero. This summer, the band casts its gaze to the stars for Warp Riders, their third full-length and their most ambitious effort to date. Warp Riders is The Sword's first concept album, a science fiction maelstrom put to the storming, relentless riffage and pounding rhythms upon which the band has staked its reputation. It's also their most flat-out, supercharged, adrenaline-pumping work yet, a chrome-plated war machine that lords over the blackened sky. From the street-prowling anthems \"\"Night City\"\" and \"\"Lawless Lands\"\" to the two-part showdown of \"\"The Chronomancer,\"\" to the furious mechanics of closing track \"\"(The Night the Sky Cried) Tears of Fire,\"\" The Sword forces eminent domain ruling over heavy metal for the next decade, and welcome all challengers for an ill-fated shot at the title. Warp Riders tells the tale of Ereth, an archer banished from his tribe on the planet Acheron. A hardscrabble planet that has undergone a tidal lock, which has caused one side to be scorched by three suns, and the other enshrouded in perpetual darkness, it is the background for a tale of strife and fantasy, the battle between pure good and pure evil. How it's told – through the dueling lead guitars of J.D. Cronise and Kyle Shutt, and the concussive rhythm section of bassist Bryan Ritchie and drummer Trivett Wingo – underscores the narrative with molten steel and unreal precision. Guitarist and lead vocalist J.D. Cronise explains the lineage of Warp Riders: \"\"I'm pretty sure the first concept album I ever heard was Operation: Mindcrime by Queensrÿche when I was a kid, which I was way into. Even though I never really understood the whole story, I was nonetheless enthralled by how the album created its own world. I wanted to create a setting for our songs that would be unique and different, but still a place where epic sagas unfold in proper Sword fashion.\"\" Inspiration took hold from \"\"lots of things … the legend of Atlantis, old Heavy Metal magazines, the films of René Laloux, a childhood dream, and The Teachings of Don Juan by Carlos Castaneda to name a few.\"\" The story of Warp Riders, entitled \"\"The Night The Sky Cried Tears Of Fire\"\" (written by Cronise), follows Ereth as he discovers a mysterious orb and meets the Chronomancer, a being beyond time and space who enlists him in a quest to restore the planet's balance. Along the way he encounters strange warriors, mysterious witches, ancient androids, and a crew of space pirates with a vessel that will alter the course of history… a vessel known as, The Sword.  "
"Walk The Moon","Family of the Year","Harlow's","Cost: $13.00 - $15.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Family of the Year  <br> Walk The Moon  <br> This past June, Seattle news and culture blog Seattlest.com posted a review of a show by Walk The Moon. It read like this: \"\"Walk The Moon hit the stage with so much energy that the crowd immediately pushed forward and started dancing. It's refreshing to see a band that's having as much, or more, fun than the people there to see them. They took us back to the days of basement dance parties on hot summer nights, where everyone's just happy to be alive and among friends.\"\" That review pretty much sums up this young Cincinnati band's mission statement: \"\"We want our music to be the most fun thing you've ever listened to in your entire life,\"\" says bassist Kevin Ray. \"\"We want it to not just affect you emotionally, but also physically in that it makes you want to dance.\"\" Everything Walk The Moon does is infused with a playful spirit, from their radiant live shows, where the crowd often coalesces into one joyful, pogo-ing mass, to the songs the band are currently recording for their debut album. The music brims with sparkling synth-heavy pop hooks, chanted melodies, sunny harmonies, and agile polyrhythmic grooves — a sound influenced by the New Wave stylings of their favorite artists Talking Heads, David Bowie, and The Police.

From September 28th, The Beards will embark upon their biggest Australian tour to date, in an attempt to convince as many cleanchins as possible to repent before it's too late. <br>“We told you to grow beards,” said The Beards' front man Johann Beardraven. “This will be your last chance.” <br>The 2012 End of The World (for beardless people) Tour will see the band take their three album back-catalogue of songs about beards throughout Australia, with dates in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra, Adelaide, Hobart, Perth, Fremantle, Bunbury, Margaret River, Newcastle, Wollongong, Byron Bay, Bundaberg, Rockhampton, Mackay, Townsville, Cairns and more. <br>“Far North Queensland is in particular need of great many beards,” said bassist Nathaniel Beard. <br>The tour will coincide with the launch of The Beards' new film clip for the song Got Me a Beard, from the album Having a Beard is the New Not Having a Beard. <br> <a href=\"\"http://www.rosemounthotel.com.au/href=\"\"rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Back to month view</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.rosemounthotel.com.au/href=\"\"rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Previous</a> <br><a href=\"\"http://www.rosemounthotel.com.au/href=\"\"rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Next</a> "

Raising the eyebrows of inquisitive metalheads and incensed parents and politicians, the record - produced by Scott Burns at the now renowned Morrisound Studios - was more extreme and confrontational than anything the metal genre had ever known. As a result of the band's brilliantly gruesome cover art, grisly lyrics and song titles like \"\"Hammer Smashed Face,\"\" \"\"Meat Hook Sodomy\"\" and \"\"Addicted To Vaginal Skin,\"\" follow-up records Butchered At Birth (1991) and Tomb Of The Mutilated (1992) were met with further contempt by the likes of such organized censorship leagues as the PMRC. In just three years, the sale of Cannibal Corpse merchandise was (temporarily) prohibited in Australia, Korea and New Zealand (in fact, the sale of Butchered At Birth and the performance of those three records is still forbidden in Germany). But dissuaded they were not. Proving technical dexterity, diabolic vocal grunts and a penchant for serial killers, zombies and gore of all shapes, sizes and textures, Cannibal Corpse won over the hearts of many a metal extremist and have since become a harrowing household name. Since the bands inception they have sold millions of albums world wide and show no sign of slowing or bowing down to the ever changing metal genre. Massive tours throughout the U.S. and Europe as well as Australia and South America only underscored the band's staying power…and all this with zero commercial radio presence and minimal video play (although the band did appear in the Hollywood blockbuster, Ace Ventura - Pet Detective). The momentum continued with the 1996 release of Vile, the first Cannibal record to feature former Monstrosity throat George \"\"Corpsegrinder\"\" Fisher following the departure of Chris Barnes. Any skepticism over the new voice behind the mighty Corpse was quickly put to rest. Simply put, Vile slayed from beginning to end and became the first ever death metal record to enter the prestigious Billboard charts. Over the next few years, relentlessly touring, bolstered musicianship and progressively more potent recordings saw the band increase in popularity within the underground and beyond. After the mass success of 2004's The Wretched Spawn and some personnel changes (longtime guitarist Jack Owen fled the band in 2004 to carry on his commitments with his rock project, Adrift. Origin axe-master Jeremy Turner filled in for the band during their remaining tours that year before Malevolent Creation/Hate Plow/Solstice guitarist Rob Barrett, who played on Cannibal Corpse's infamous releases The Bleeding and Vile records, rejoined the band as a fulltime member.), Cannibal Corpse has returned to the Death Metal frontlines with the pungently eloquent majesty that is Kill. Simply titled but meticulously assembled, Kill was recorded with producer Erik Rutan (Hate Eternal/ex-Morbid Angel) at Mana Studios in St. Petersburg, Florida. The tenth record of their storied career, each track basks in its own claustrophobic abrasiveness and maniacal subject matter. From the onset of the fiery \"\"The Time To Kill Is Now,\"\" guitarists Barrett and Pat O'Brien, vocalist George \"\"Corpsegrinder\"\" Fisher, bassist Alex Webster and drummer Paul Mazurkiewicz pummel with a renewed sense of urgency. Fast, furious and scrupulously timed, the tune is a palpable reminder that Cannibal remains a force to be reckoned. \"\"Make Them Suffer\"\" sears with an old school Possessed vibe (a band to whom Cannibal has paid homage to on several occasions), while \"\"Necrosadistic Warning,\"\" replete with a barrage of blistering solo work by O'Brien whose guitar deftness is often underestimated, comes riddled with visions of zombies sexually gratifying themselves with the body parts of the beings they've slain. Other tracks like the telling \"\"Five Nails Through The Neck,\"\" \"\"Death Walking Terror,\"\" \"\"Brain Removal Device\"\" and instrumental closer \"\"Infinite Misery\"\" see the five-piece at their most cogent, both lyrically and musically.

He's become the most buzz-worthy current Reggae artist over the past few years. In the summer, 2007, Collie Buddz' Columbia Records self-titled debut album stormed the charts entering the Billboard Reggae Chart at first position. The Reggae singjay became an international star when this album went on to debut across the world on every chart from Japan to Germany. With much of the production coming from Collie himself, he delivered a solid effort with contributions from Supa Dups, Shea Taylor, Bang Out, Screwface, Bobby Konders, and Crown N Kah-So-Real. Released just a day before US Independence Day, Collie's album could be heard blasting out of car windows from Brooklyn to Kingston all summer long. Critically speaking, Collie's debut was a monster, his first single, an undeniable summer anthem titled, \"\"Come Around\"\". Source Magazine proclaimed, \"\"This 24 year old shotta has got an anthem spreading across the seas.\"\" Hip Hop Weekly said, \"\"Collie Buddz is one of the most firmly grounded voices you may ever encounter.\"\" The industry excitement about this new voice in music manifested in many ways namely by inspiring Collie's musical peers to either create their own remixes of \"\"Come Around,\"\" or join Collie on the official remix of the single. Busta Rhymes, G-Unit, Shaggy, and Cypress Hill, all contributed to the anthem. Incorporating influences from Hip-Hop to Soca, Collie's music nevertheless has a rock-solid foundation in Reggae - and its power to connect ghetto reality with the highest heights of human aspiration - that is a rarity even in Jamaica. But, to say he's connected to the Caribbean community would be an understatement. Collie Buddz, born Colin Harper, has become the Caribbean culture's resident ambassador. Touring extensively, Collie's passport stamps are a relative reflection of the worldwide love for Reggae and Caribbean culture. From Madison Square Garden to Dubai, Collie Buddz is the definition of an international recording artist. \"\"It was crazy performing in the Middle East. Who would have guessed how big reggae music is there? They knew all my songs,\"\" a jubilant Buddz explains. He has toured throughout Germany, France, England, Japan, North and South America and the Caribbean. His unique blend of Hip-Hop, Soca and Dancehall underlined with his ever-present passion for the modern Roots Reggae sound has attracted tastemaker supporters all over the world. Reggae pioneer David Rodigan [London] and New York Reggae stalwarts, Massive B are just some of his most ardent supporters. Now on the verge of Collie's sophomore album release, the anticipation is palpable. In spite of a heavy touring schedule since 2007, Collie is prepared to release a sophomore album that promises an even greater insight into the multi-talented, singer/producer. \"\"We don't have a title for the new album just yet but whatever we call it, the album will be mad,\"\" Collie excitedly explains. With production by Supa Dups, Massive B, and Seani B among other contributors, Collie's fans can anticipate Collie's unique twist on popular music. After ending his affiliation with Columbia Records/Sony Music Entertainment, Inc in 2008, he found fewer restrictions on the indy scene and has since founded his own independent record label, Harper Digital alongside his brother [Smokey] and DJ [Genie] while working with his longtime management group, Mojiza Management. Humble as always, Collie simply says, \"\"I'm just excited to be putting out another album. I love to make music and the satisfaction is in having other people from all over the world enjoy it. I live out of a suitcase and I wouldn't have it any other way.\"\"  "

Being signed before even their first show, and only weeks after being “public” from Atlanta’s local scene, these kids pack a powerful punch easily seen behind they’re catchy choruses, and punchy break downs. Either it being “Electronical” influences, or “balls” full instrumentation the constant energy is never lacking amongst they’re tracks. New to the public ear Woe, Is Me sets fourth to record they’re album in May/June of 2010 Number[s] being the name of their anticipated LP, you can only be sure to expect nothing less from these power-house group of guys. “I always had a thing for heavy/electronically driven music” Austin Thornton (Ex: drummer from Of Machines) explains. “That’s the basis that we built WIM around although it’s only semi-represented in our current available tracks, our new material will truly highlight that “metal/electrical” sound we’ve came to acquire over time, so I’d expect nothing less then a heavier/melodic side of us, for sure hah no joke! ” Starting to tour in early/late July, with the drive behind them this “experimental melodic-core” band will be sure to stand against any mountain put in front of them.

"Yellowcard","We Are The In Crowd","The Masquerade"," Monday November 12th <br>Heaven • 7:00 PM • $20.00 ADV <br> Yellowcard <br> The Wonder Years, We Are The In Crowd <br> Getting an opportunity to make an impact by playing music is a dream for many bands. But getting a second chance, according to Yellowcard frontman Ryan Key, is a blessing. Yellowcard returned to the spotlight in 2011 after a three-year hiatus with the energized When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes. The album was a renaissance of sorts for the Jacksonville natives, as its 10 tracks played out like the band never spent any time apart.

But getting a second chance, according to Yellowcard frontman Ryan Key, is a blessing. Yellowcard returned to the spotlight in 2011 after a three-year hiatus with the energized When You're Through Thinking, Say Yes. The album was a renaissance of sorts for the Jacksonville natives, as its 10 tracks played out like the band never spent any time apart.

"Typhoon","Laura Gibson","Echo","Cost: $12.00 - $14.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Laura Gibson, Lost Lander  <br> Typhoon  <br> Dear Reader, I once came very close to dying (bug-bite, failed organs), and though my life was spared thanks to thanks to modern medicine and a kidney given to me by my father, nonetheless I live with a persisting sense that my time is borrowed. My resolution--what I intend to do with my finite allotment-- is to reach some small, yet conclusive understanding of my life in particular and the world in general an understanding accomplished, in part, through a combination of music and words. The last record we made, Hunger & Thirst, is a record that purposefully confuses physical sickness with ontological sickness, i.e. that most desires are only symptoms of the desire to be someone else. This new record picks up where we left off, though this time \"\"purposefully confusing\"\" the idea of time as a place. It imagines that my past is a composite of old houses and apartment buildings, that my memories are these little artifacts strewn about, and then there's me with a single candle, picking up the artifacts one at a time and examining them by the dim light. Songs as personal as these perhaps ought to be burned or buried rather than be paraded before an audience. But there is something transfigurative in playing music with so many close friends--what starts out as a solemn, solitary attempt is turned into something both communal and cathartic. I think we even have fun at times. A New Kind of House (the title itself is borrowed from the brilliant poetry of Zach Schomburg) was artfully recorded on location (our house) by repeat-collaborator Paul Laxer the artwork was beautifully realized by Ricky Delucco, and we have Tender Loving Empire to thank for so tenderly helping us put out a record a second time.

This summer, the band casts its gaze to the stars for Warp Riders, their third full-length and their most ambitious effort to date. Warp Riders is The Sword's first concept album, a science fiction maelstrom put to the storming, relentless riffage and pounding rhythms upon which the band has staked its reputation. It's also their most flat-out, supercharged, adrenaline-pumping work yet, a chrome-plated war machine that lords over the blackened sky.

"Kaki King","Lady Lamb the Beekeeper","Tremont Music Hall - Casbah","Cost: $15.00 - $17.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Lady Lamb The Beekeeper, The Bear Romantic  <br> Kaki King  <br> Hailed by Rolling Stone as \"\"a genre unto herself,\"\" Kaki King is a true iconoclast, a visionary musician/artist whose singular work rightly stands out amongst the easily formatted. Over her decade-long career thus far, the Brooklyn-based guitarist/composer has recorded five extraordinarily diverse and distinctive LPs, performed with such icons as Foo Fighters, Timbaland, and The Mountain Goats, contributed to a variety of film and TV soundtracks (spanning Golden Globe-nominated work on Sean Penn's Into The Wild to scoring – and appearing in as guitar-playing hand double – the acclaimed 2007 drama, August Rush), and played to ever-growing audiences on innumerable world tours. Each twist and veer marked the turning of a page, another step forward on a truly exceptional musical path. Beginning with 2002's Everybody Loves You – to date, her only fully acoustic guitar recording – King has expanded and reconceived the role of the solo instrumental artist, constantly kicking at the boundaries of what's expected. Glow, her groundbreaking new Velour Music Group release, is both indescribable and definitive, an evocative, exuberant collection of genre agnostic soundscapes, rich with wit, theme, and inspired invention. From the chamberesque \"\"Great Round Burn\"\" through the propulsive, Celtic-colored \"\"King Pizel,\"\" the album embraces a doggedly naturalist production ethos to showcase King's protean songwriting and mesmeric fretboard genius. While her emblematic usage of imaginative tunings, rare instruments, and idiosyncratic percussive techniques are all featured to their fullest effect, the undeniable lodestar of Glow is Kaki King's remarkable, reverberant guitar. \"\"This is a guitar record,\"\" she says. \"\"This is the sound of a person playing guitar. Whatever additions we made, the fundamental of this record is still one person playing a guitar. That's who I am.\"\" Glow marks a kind of artistic reboot for King, whose most recent recordings integrated traditional songcraft, additional musicians, and her own vocal stylings, all in pursuit of her tenaciously individualistic sonic vision. Though critically acclaimed, the release of 2010's band-oriented Junior was followed by a self-described \"\"existential crisis.\"\" Thrown by the unplanned directions her life and music had taken, King was suddenly hesitant of the way forward. \"\"A lot of life happened between this record and the last one,\"\" she says. \"\"There was a lot of serious doubt, a lot of fear, wondering if I wanted to do this anymore. I didn't know if being a musician was how it was going to be for me. I've been playing guitar since I was 4 years old, I've known no other life, so the question became, is this really what I'm going to spend the rest of my life doing?\"\" A worldwide solo tour proved just the ticket for clearing her head and restoring her perspective. Dubbed \"\"The Traveling Freak Guitar Show Tour,\"\" the international trek – which saw King accompanied onstage only by a scope of esoteric stringed instruments – allowed the prodigious guitarist to reconnect with her symbiotic musical partner. \"\"I thought, okay, let's go back to what we know,\"\" King says, \"\"and what we know how to do is play guitar. That's where I've always been able to shine, for myself, without any doubts.\"\" In March 2012, King paid a visit to Casa Chica, Incubus guitarist Mike Einziger's Malibu home studio. With \"\"very little concept other than I wanted to play guitar,\"\" she laid down an intriguing series of solo tracks and demos. Upon her return home, King considered how best to proceed. Having previously worked with such highly regarded producers as Malcolm Burn and John McEntire, this time she simply hoped to find a sympathetic mixer/engineer, someone who had \"\"the ability to find and create magical sounds.\"\" Enter D. James Goodwin, producer, engineer, mixer, and owner of the residential Woodstock, NY studio, The Isokon. An early playback of Behold! This Dreamer by Thieving Irons, an album featuring her frequent collaborator Dan Brantigan and engineered by Goodwin, convinced King that she had found her collaborative partner. \"\"I could tell that this guy heard things that I never could,\"\" she says. In the weeks leading up the sessions, King was contacted by the acclaimed New York based string quartet, ETHEL, wondering if she might like to work with them sometime in the distant future. \"\"Classical performance programs are usually set up two years in advance,\"\" King explains, \"\"so I said, 'How about we do something together now?' Armed with a like-minded co-producer, a gifted string quartet, and a fistful of intriguing new songs, King headed to bucolic Woodstock in mid-May. The Isokon proved an ideal working environment and Goodwin, a genuinely simpatico collaborator. King set to work in as spontaneous and organic a fashion as possible, consciously placing few impediments on the creative flow. \"\"Our attitude was, let's just start,\"\" King says. \"\"Let's not discuss. Let's just pick up something and see where it takes us. And that took us places that were very unexpected.\"\" Inspiration flowed from an array of influences and ideas. \"\"Cargo Cult\"\" and the kinetic \"\"Kelvinator, Kelvinator\"\" see King exploring the \"\"uncharted territory\"\" of Open D minor tuning, while a number of other tracks were born of the \"\"tiny, bright sound\"\" created by her treasured Veillette Gryphon High 12. King declares the high-strung 12-string guitar to be \"\"a songwriting machine. I want to make a whole record with that little guy. It's almost like you sit down with it and things just come out underneath your fingers.\"\" While her concentration was firmly aimed towards her guitar, King is also personally responsible for Glow's complete sonic scrum, including all percussion. Also present are such creative colorings as bagpipes, string arrangements, and the occasional bass part (played by Goodwin). Notably absent is her characteristic vocalizing, though their exclusion is less by design than by the demands of the material. \"\"Vocals just didn't write themselves,\"\" King says. \"\"If something had spoken to me, we would have set up a vocal mic immediately, but it just didn't and it would have interfered with the process to try and force it.\"\" Glow finishes on an intriguingly somber note with \"\"March Slav,\"\" a haunting piece inspired by Goodwin and King's mutual fascination with Russian history and the Soviet aesthetic, its title of course borrowed from Tchaikovsky. That closing nod to the great Russian composer points to King's emerging interest in contemporary classical and new music. Future plans include teaming with ETHEL on an upcoming Bach performance, while Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang has commissioned her to write a piece for a series he'll be curating at Carnegie Hall. Having spent the last decade restlessly adventuring, the afterglow of Glow finds Kaki King considerably more settled, though no less curious and artistically ambitious. Always a resolutely freethinking musician, a new and vast range of possibilities seems to have opened up for the ever-evolving, always unconventional King. \"\"For a long time I wondered, how am I going to have a normal life, how am I going to be an adult, and still write good music,\"\" she says. \"\"The answer came from not worrying about it. I'm just not going to argue with the muse anymore.\"\"  "

Notably absent is her characteristic vocalizing, though their exclusion is less by design than by the demands of the material. \"\"Vocals just didn't write themselves,\"\" King says. \"\"If something had spoken to me, we would have set up a vocal mic immediately, but it just didn't and it would have interfered with the process to try and force it.\"\" Glow finishes on an intriguingly somber note with \"\"March Slav,\"\" a haunting piece inspired by Goodwin and King's mutual fascination with Russian history and the Soviet aesthetic, its title of course borrowed from Tchaikovsky. That closing nod to the great Russian composer points to King's emerging interest in contemporary classical and new music. Future plans include teaming with ETHEL on an upcoming Bach performance, while Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Lang has commissioned her to write a piece for a series he'll be curating at Carnegie Hall. Having spent the last decade restlessly adventuring, the afterglow of Glow finds Kaki King considerably more settled, though no less curious and artistically ambitious. Always a resolutely freethinking musician, a new and vast range of possibilities seems to have opened up for the ever-evolving, always unconventional King. \"\"For a long time I wondered, how am I going to have a normal life, how am I going to be an adult, and still write good music,\"\" she says. \"\"The answer came from not worrying about it. I'm just not going to argue with the muse anymore.\"\"  "

Having begun at age 11 with classical and flamenco lessons and gradually applying his teachings to the electric and steel string acoustic guitar, Bruno's unique stylings truly have a sound all their own. After stints as a lead guitarist and songwriter for many acclaimed bands (most notably Crowded Streets, a Dave Matthews Band Tribute), Bruno decided it was time to give his fans a bigger taste of his personal musical journey, and thus, Last Second Left was born. Last Second Left's repertoire has been influenced by such notable musicians as Carlos Santana, Baden Powell, Tim Mahoney and Mike Einziger, but it also goes beyond that to truly display Bruno's growth as both a songwriter and guitarist. With guest vocalist Lindsay Hough of The Fishermen and a plethora of other talented backing musicians accompanying Bruno, the final sound demonstrated throughout his self-titled debut album is one of richness and depth. Last Second Left's live shows will also be sure to please, as Bruno is determined to take his fans along with him on his musical voyage, sharing with audiences the energy and passion with which he lives his life - both on stage and off. <br><a href=\"\"http://lastsecondleft.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">Official site</a> "

He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

As a performer, LIZZ brought her political wit to The Daily Show as a Correspondent and later to the radio waves co-hosting Unfiltered, Air America Radio’s mid morning show, where she brought on board Hip Hop legend CHUCK D and political big brain RACHEL MADDOW.  <br> LIZZ’S talents as a comedian and media visionary have been recognized by The New York Times, The Washington Post, Entertainment Weekly’s 100 most Creative People issue and has brought numerous television appearances, including Comedy Central Presents and as a regular contributor for MSNBC’s “The Ed Show” and “The Joy Behar Show.”  <br> Most recently, Lizz wrote and produced an independent pilot of her Off-Broadway hit, “WAKE UP WORLD, a show Rachel Maddow called, “The funniest thing I have seen in years.”  <br>Max Silvestri <br>Max Silvestri is the host of the award-winning Big Terrific comedy showcase. He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

He has written for the Onion AV Club and Gawker, and New York Magazine called him one of the \"\"Ten Comedians People Find Funny\"\". <br>Hari Kondabolu <br> According to the Seattle Times, Hari Kondabolu is “a young man reaching for the hand-scalding torch of confrontational comics like Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor.” Like his comedic heroes, Hari Kondabolu wants to speak truth to power with confrontational and personal material. Unlike them, he does not want to die of a morphine overdose or set himself on fire.  <br> Hari has performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Comedy Central’s Live at Gotham and John Oliver’s New York Standup Show and the 2007 HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. His Comedy Central Presents half-hour television special debuted on the network in February 2011.  <br> In addition to standup at colleges, clubs and fundraisers around the country, Hari also co-hosts the mostly improvised, monthly talk show The Untitled Kondabolu Brothers Project with his younger brother Ashok (“Dap” from hip hop group Das Racist) in New York City.  <br>Hari is also a former video blogger for WORLD COMPASS, a joint initiative between WGBH Boston, PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.  <br> In 2009, he made his major motion picture acting debut in the 20th Century Fox Film All About Steve, which the Boston Globe’s Ty Burr said was “to comedy what leprosy once was to the island of Molokai: a plague best contemplated from many miles away.” (It should be noted that he had a very small part. It was tiny. He’s practically not even in the movie.)  <br> Of more consequence, Hari’s short film MANOJ, which he wrote, starred in, and co-produced with director Zia Mohajerjasbi, was selected to play at the 2009 Just for Laughs Festival in Chicago, 2008 Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal and was a Finalist in the 2007-2008 Boston Motion Picture Awards. Unbelievably, the film was also licensed by “Showtime Arabia” in Dubai.  <br> Hari was born and raised in Queens, NY. He went to Townsend Harris High School and the school’s mascot, “Hari the Hawk,” was named after him during his senior year. (He sometimes fears that his greatest achievement was accomplished at 17.) He also attended both Bowdoin College and Wesleyan University, graduating from the former institution with a B.A. in Comparative Politics in 2004. A former immigrant rights organizer in Seattle, Hari also earned a Masters in Human Rights from the London School of Economics in 2008, writing a merit- earning dissertation entitled “Mexican Returnees as Internally Displaced People: An Argument for the Protection of Economic Migrants Under the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement.” This is, by far, the least funny thing he’s ever written.  <br><a href=\"\"http://www.harikondabolu.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.harikondabolu.com/</a> <br>David Rees <br><a href=\"\"http://lepoissonrouge.com/events/view/3775\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.mnftiu.cc/</a> <br> photo credit: Meredith Heuer  <br>The Yes Men <br><a href=\"\"http://theyesmen.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://theyesmen.org/</a> <br>John Cameron Mitchell <br>photo via <a href=\"\"http://www.passportmagazine.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">passportmagazine.com</a> <br>Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel <br>Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth <br>Guy Picciotto of Fugazi <br>Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio <br>Climbing PoeTree <br><a href=\"\"http://www.climbingpoetree.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://www.climbingpoetree.com/</a> <br>the Invisible Army of Defaulters <br>members of Healthcare for the 99% <br><a href=\"\"http://owshealthcare.wordpress.com/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\"> http://owshealthcare.wo"

Instead of collecting the debt, we will abolish it and help free the debtors!  <br> People shouldn’t have to go into debt for an education, because they need medical care, or to put food on the table during hard times. We shouldn’t have to pay endless interest to the 1% for basic necessities. Big banks and corporations walk away from their debts and leave taxpayers to pick up the tab. It’s time for a bailout of the people, by the people.  <br> It will be a wild night of music, comedy, magic, education, and the unexpected. This fast-moving variety show will mix well-known performers, intellectuals and activists from Strike Debt and Occupy Wall Street.  <br> Special guests include Janeane Garofalo, Lizz Winstead, Frances Fox Piven, Max Silvestri, Hari Kondabolu, David Rees, The Yes Men, actor/director John Cameron Mitchell, Jeff Mangum of Neutral Milk Hotel, Lee Ranaldo of Sonic Youth, Guy Picciotto of Fugazi, Tunde Adebimpe of TV on the Radio, Climbing PoeTree, the Invisible Army of Defaulters, members of Healthcare for the 99%, Occupy Faith, and many more.  <br>*Tickets will go on-sale Friday, November 2nd at 10AM* <br> $25 (abolishes an estimated $500 worth of debt) <br> $50 (abolishes an estimated $1000 worth of debt) <br> $100 (abolishes an estimated $2000 worth of debt) <br> $250 (abolishes an estimated $5000 worth of debt)  <br> This event will be streamed live at <a href=\"\"http://www.rollingjubilee.org/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow\"\">www.rollingjubilee.org</a> <br> This is a general admission, standing event.  <br>Artists <br>The People’s Bailout: A Variety Show and Telethon to Benefit the 99% <br> The Rolling Jubilee is a project of Strike Debt, which emerged out of Occupy Wall Street and is dedicated to raising public awareness about predatory debt practices, debt resistance and mutual aid. Debt is the tie that binds the 99%, from recent graduates paying hundreds of dollars in interest every month on their student loans, to elderly homeowners underwater to the banks, to teachers and firefighters forced to take pay cuts because their cities are broke, to countries that that have to slash school and hospital budgets to pay back bondholders.

His debut album, Long Black Train was certified platinum for more than 1 million copies sold, and his sophomore album, Your Man, was one of only four country albums to reach double-platinum status in 2006. The debut single from his fourth album Haywire, “Why Don’t We Just Dance,” a four-week No. 1 hit was the most-played song at country radio in 2010, according to Mediabase and #3 on Billboard’s year-end Hot Country Songs list, followed immediately by “All Over Me” at No. 4. \"\"Why Don't We Just Dance,\"\" took home an American Country Award for \"\"Single of the Year-Male\"\" in December of the same year.  Scoring back-to-back #1's with his second single release from Haywire, “All Over Me,” made Turner one of only seven country artists to have two No. 1 hits in 2010.

"New Found Glory","The Story So Far","Troubadour","Cost: Adv tix $31.00 / Day of Show $34.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: The Story So Far, Seahaven  <br> New Found Glory  <br> The anticipated new album Radiosurgery from pop punk heroes New Found Glory is set to arrive in stores October 4th via Epitaph Records. Fans can preorder the album now by going to the Epitaph Store. The first single from the album, title track “Radiosurgery” is currently available for download at iTunes. The album Radiosurgery continues the band’s high energy musical journey while simultaneously paying homage to the bands that inspired them to first pick up instruments as teenagers back in Coral Springs Florida. “Our music is constantly evolving and changing and when this band puts out an album we always try to offer something different,” explains guitarist Chad Gilbert. “With this disc we wanted to go back to the music that got us into punk and incorporate influences from those albums.” For this latest venture, New Found Glory was aided by a trusted producer Neal Avron, who worked with the band on Catalyst in 2004, and has honed his chops in the interim with artists like Fall Out Boy and Linkin Park. The resulting songs sound undeniably like New Found Glory but they also have a timeless punk feel that will appeal to both diehard fans as well as new converts. “This album is a culmination of all of our albums put together and in a lot of ways we feel like a new band when we’re playing these songs because they’re so energized and they affirm the fact that we’re going to be a band for a long time,” summarizes guitarist Steve Klein. “In a lot of ways it feels like we’re just getting started.” The band also announced its Fall Headline Tour entitled Pop Punk’s Not Dead, presented by Rockstar Energy Drink. Tour pre-sale begins today and fans can get tickets at reduced fees along with special ticket/album bundle packages by going to: http://newfoundglory.ducatking.com.  "
"Streetlight Manifesto","LIONIZE","Exit In","Cost: $17.50 - $20.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: Hostage Calm, Lionize  <br> Streetlight Manifesto  <br> Of all the various compliments Streetlight Manifesto have received from fans over the years, there is one in particular that seems to resonate most with the members of the band. After a show, a kid in torn jeans and a Pantera shirt, sporting ridiculous facial hair, will find one of the Streetlighters outside of the club and say hello, followed by \"\"Man, I don't listen to this kind of music, in fact I hate most ska bands, but you guys are something else.\"\" Or it will be a jazz fan, sitting in the back of the venue during the set, bobbing his head, eyes closed while the band does their thing on stage. Or one of the club's stagehands will comment, while helping break down the lighting rig, that he actually enjoyed a band he was working for for once, despite having heard thousands of bands on the job over the years. And therein lies Streetlight Manifesto's appeal. Seven guys, seven different musical backgrounds, seven different personalities, one band, one unique and unmistakable voice. Formed four years ago in New Jersey as an ad hoc group intended to put out one album and disappear, one thing lead to another and within a few months of their debut release, Everything Goes Numb, Streetlight Manifesto were officially a full time touring band, traveling the world, spreading their infectious and energetic tunes to all who would listen. One part rock, one part ska, with influences from latin, klezmer, folk, world, funk, jazz and classical thrown in, the band redefined what most people expected from a \"\"ska\"\" band. Three albums later, and after countless worldwide tours, the guys are still at it, still performing live to sold out shows filled with sweat drenched fans, all dancing and singing along at the top of their lungs. And the Streetlight boys wouldn't have it any other way.  "

Combining their interests in various musical and artistic styles, the band has successfully accumulated an impressive international fan base, press accolades, and defied categorization with their unique sound and visuals. The band was formed in 1999 and independently produced and recorded their first two albums, Nothing and Nowhere and Violet. Through both of these high-demand releases, as well as their highly acclaimed and beautifully atmospheric website, the band obtained a large and loyal fan base throughout the world. Due to their independent success, in 2005 they were approached by European record label Repo Records (followed shortly by Metropolis Records in North America) and the band began its steady climb to reaching a much wider audience with the 2007 release of the acclaimed and wildly popular Walking With Strangers. In the last few years, the band has been performing internationally, traveling extensively across Canada, the United States, Mexico, Australia, the U.K. and Europe. They have become renowned for their high-energy live performances, drawing large, mixed crowds through their appeal to fans of a surprisingly wide range of genres. Equally comfortable playing intimate venues as they are on a festival stage, the band's highly-praised performances will continue into the next year as they continue touring. Their fourth full length album \"\"Pins And Needles\"\" will be released on September 14th and will be accompanied with a release tour from Sept. 8-15th. Currently, the band is preparing for shows in the U.S.A and Toronto for the Cd release tour... and they will also be returning to the U.K. in October....AND the USA again in November.  "

Born in Buffalo, NY and raised in Chicago (where he played with Chicago Blues legends Eddie Taylor and J.B. Hutto), Jony learned blues guitar listening to Albert King, Otis Rush, Buddy Guy & B.B. King. While these are his influences Jony's Blues are his own. "
"New Found Glory","The Story So Far","The Glass House","Cost: $29.00 - $33.00.  <br> Supporting Acts: The Story So Far, Seahaven  <br> New Found Glory  <br> New found energy, new found purpose: that's what Not Without A Fight is all about. The first New Found Glory album to bear the Epitaph logo brims with fresh promise, showcasing a band comfortable in their own skin and eager to get back to basics and present it all to the world. Not Without A Fight is arguably the strongest addition to an impressive catalog with no less than three gold records and some of the most memorable songs of the past decade. Album opener \"\"Right Where We Left Off\"\" is an instant reminder of the keen self-awareness that endeared New Found Glory to millions of fans worldwide in the first place. And naming their album Not Without A Fight? That's a nod to that other side of the group Epitaph owner Brett Gurewitz called \"\"the greatest pop-punk band in history,\"\" the side that is scrappy, that's from the do-it-yourself scene. The side of a band who probably never should have been lumped in with some of the more teeny-bop friendly fare they've often shared the rock radio and TRL charts with. Lead single \"\"Listen to Your Friends\"\" flips the script by rocking a verse even catchier than its chorus \"\"I'll Never Love Again\"\" boasts a killer singalong. \"\"47\"\" has a hooky scream that breaks new ground for the Florida-bred five-some while \"\"Truck Stop Blues\"\" summons the potent urgency of the burgeoning scene that New Found Glory arose from, recalling a bygone era when they shared small stages with their friends in Get Up Kids, Piebald and Saves The Day. Not Without A Fight packs together the best elements of fan favorite albums like Sticks and Stones (2002) and Catalyst (2004) with a reinvigorated drive making for a declaration that's fresh and timely. There's pop, there's punk, there's crunch, there's those irrepressible melodies and Jordan Pundik's instantly recognizable voice is in fine form. \"\"Nobody in New Found Glory loves anything as much as this band,\"\" says guitarist Chad Gilbert, by way of explanation as to how they have managed to maintain the same lineup - Pundik, Gilbert, Steven Klein (guitar), Ian Grushka (bass) and Cyrus Bolooki (drums) - for over ten years. \"\"You fight with your mom. You don't hang out with her all the time. But you love her! You're never going to hate her. We're family. It might sound cliche, but that's what it is.\"\"  "
"Brother Joscephus and the Love Revival Revolution ","","The Hamilton Live","Doors open at 7:00, show starts at 8:30.  <br>Brother Joscephus and the Love Revival Revolution Orchestra is a 12-piece explosion of righteousness that blends New Orleans party music, Soul in the style of Ray Charles and Al Green, a good helping of jam-bandy Roots Rock and a righteous splash of good, upbeat Gospel without the religious overtones (We like to call it secular gospel).  <br>In the group’s short history they have already made a big splash in the NYC music scene, sharing the stage with New Orleans stalwarts such as the Rebirth Brass Band, Trombone Shorty, Dirty Dozen Brass Band, Bonerama, Big Sam’s Funky Nation, the New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars and Eric Lindell. They’ve sold out legendary venues such as the Highline Ballroom and BB King’s.  <br>A Love Revival with Brother Joscephus is more than just excellent original live music. BroJo is also all about the spectacle and pageantry - it’s a life changing EXPERIENCE! The orchestra is decked out in their finest whites (accented with the appropriate gold, purple and green of Mardi Gras). They break out parasols, start each set with a parade through the audience and throw out hundreds of Mardi Gras beads over the course of a show. When the parade starts grooving the crowd can't help but have a good time. It's undeniable!! "
